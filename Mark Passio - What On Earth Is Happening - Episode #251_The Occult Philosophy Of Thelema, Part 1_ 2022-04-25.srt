00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:40,319
philosophy called thelema

i do want to switch over to my laptop

58
00:02:52,959 --> 00:02:54,480
and go through a couple of housekeeping

59
00:02:54,480 --> 00:02:56,000
announcements before we jump into the

60
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,239
main material for today

61
00:02:58,239 --> 00:03:01,440
last week we were off for easter

62
00:03:01,440 --> 00:03:03,519
i hope everybody had a good easter and

63
00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:07,120
you know, we're back into programming

64
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:09,360
this week, and

65
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:11,760
the how to become the true media seminar

66
00:03:11,760 --> 00:03:14,000
is coming at us rapidly, we are filling

67
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,239
up the seats of the seminar

68
00:03:16,239 --> 00:03:20,640
so, let me jump over to the laptop

69
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:23,920
thank you to Will Keller for the great

70
00:03:23,920 --> 00:03:26,400
artwork, as always

71
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:28,080
again, the topic for today the occult

72
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:30,959
philosophy of thelema, it's gonna be

73
00:03:30,959 --> 00:03:32,400
something that

74
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:35,360
some people are gonna get and hopefully

75
00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:36,560
they will

76
00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:39,599
research more deeply into it, and some

77
00:03:39,599 --> 00:03:42,000
people will never understand

78
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,239
they will insist that this is

79
00:03:44,239 --> 00:03:45,760
something that i shouldn't even be

80
00:03:45,760 --> 00:03:48,080
discussing or talking about, and, you know

81
00:03:48,080 --> 00:03:50,000
insist it's what other people

82
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,799
have told them that it is, instead

83
00:03:52,799 --> 00:03:55,680
of them looking at it for themselves and

84
00:03:55,680 --> 00:03:58,000
deciding what it really is, from

85
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:01,840
personal first-hand investigation

86
00:04:02,640 --> 00:04:05,519
so, we're on the new format, of course

87
00:04:05,519 --> 00:04:07,920

88
00:04:07,920 --> 00:04:09,280

it closes on july 4th of this year

99
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:36,400
that's one week before the seminar

100
00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:38,800

regarding how to do

if you want to start a video podcast, if

106
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:52,240
you want to start an audio podcast, if

107
00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:53,680
you want to start a website, if you want

108
00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:56,960
to put videos out and talk about what's

109
00:04:56,960 --> 00:04:58,400
going on in the world, and help to

110
00:04:58,400 --> 00:05:00,400
enlighten other people

111
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:01,840
and help to make them aware of what's

112
00:05:01,840 --> 00:05:03,360
really taking place

113
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:05,360
instead of what the lying

114
00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:08,560
prostitute mainstream media tells them

115
00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:10,479
this is the seminar for you, if you feel

116
00:05:10,479 --> 00:05:13,680
like you have gotten the material

117
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:15,360
that i have been discussing and teaching

118
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:16,960
to date

119
00:05:16,960 --> 00:05:18,560
but you

120
00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:20,400
yourself

121
00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:23,360
know that you need to teach it to others

122
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:25,360
and you just don't know how to go about

123
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:28,960
doing that, and how to begin that process

124
00:05:28,960 --> 00:05:31,039
this is the seminar

125
00:05:31,039 --> 00:05:32,960
this is what will teach you all of those

126
00:05:32,960 --> 00:05:36,240
steps from the very beginning

127
00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:40,240
it's a 23-week intensive seminar

128
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:41,919
we're going to be talking about a lot of

129
00:05:41,919 --> 00:05:44,240
different technological aspects, from

130
00:05:44,240 --> 00:05:46,960
like i said

131
00:05:46,960 --> 00:05:48,400
everything from

132
00:05:48,400 --> 00:05:50,840
the file system, how to organize

133
00:05:50,840 --> 00:05:54,320
files, to making an outline of your

134
00:05:54,320 --> 00:05:56,639
thoughts

135
00:05:56,720 --> 00:05:59,199
to making presentations

136
00:05:59,199 --> 00:06:01,360
slides like this

137
00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:03,600
graphics

138
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:06,880
up through audio, video and making your

139
00:06:06,880 --> 00:06:08,960
own website to

140
00:06:08,960 --> 00:06:11,199
keep a central repository of all your

141
00:06:11,199 --> 00:06:13,199
work and distribute it out there to

142
00:06:13,199 --> 00:06:14,639
others

143
00:06:14,639 --> 00:06:16,400
so, the seminar this year is taking place

144
00:06:16,400 --> 00:06:18,880
every monday evening 8 to 11 pm eastern

145
00:06:18,880 --> 00:06:22,400
time, from monday july 11th through

146
00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:25,919
monday december 12, 2022

147
00:06:25,919 --> 00:06:28,080
that's a total of 23 class sessions

148
00:06:28,080 --> 00:06:30,319
there is limited space available

149
00:06:30,319 --> 00:06:32,800
in this technology seminar, we're hosting

150
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:36,080
it on telegram this year

151
00:06:36,080 --> 00:06:37,759
a couple of questions have come up, you

152
00:06:37,759 --> 00:06:39,360
do need a cell phone

153
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:41,680
to at least get enrolled in the seminar

154
00:06:41,680 --> 00:06:43,919
i really don't recommend

155
00:06:43,919 --> 00:06:46,479
taking the seminar on a smartphone

156
00:06:46,479 --> 00:06:48,000
but you're going to need a cell phone at

157
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:50,720
least to get enrolled, because

158
00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:52,720
a cell phone is required to download the

159
00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:55,120
telegram mobile app

160
00:06:55,120 --> 00:06:56,479
after which

161
00:06:56,479 --> 00:06:58,880
you can download the telegram desktop

162
00:06:58,880 --> 00:07:00,880
app, which i recommend taking the course

163
00:07:00,880 --> 00:07:02,800
on

164
00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:05,599
and in order to get that linked to your

165
00:07:05,599 --> 00:07:08,400
mobile account you do need to download

166
00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:10,800
the smartphone app, so, there were a

167
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:12,880
couple questions regarding that you do

168
00:07:12,880 --> 00:07:15,199
need a smartphone in order to get

169
00:07:15,199 --> 00:07:17,759
telegram installed on your computer, on

170
00:07:17,759 --> 00:07:20,639
your desktop or laptop computer, because

171
00:07:20,639 --> 00:07:22,960
it makes you take a

172
00:07:22,960 --> 00:07:25,440
picture of the qr code, and that is how

173
00:07:25,440 --> 00:07:27,759
it links the desktop app to the mobile

174
00:07:27,759 --> 00:07:28,639
app

175
00:07:28,639 --> 00:07:30,160
so, i just wanted to put that out there

176
00:07:30,160 --> 00:07:32,720
for anyone that did have a question

177
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:35,360
regarding what is needed, all that is

178
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:36,639
needed is a

179
00:07:36,639 --> 00:07:38,880
desktop or laptop computer that is

180
00:07:38,880 --> 00:07:41,120
capable of running the telegram desktop

181
00:07:41,120 --> 00:07:43,360
app, but you do need a cell phone to get

182
00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:44,720
registered

183
00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:46,240
and to get the

184
00:07:46,240 --> 00:07:48,720
telegram desktop app linked to the

185
00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:51,360
mobile app, that just should be

186
00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:53,599
clarified and hopefully that takes care

187
00:07:53,599 --> 00:07:55,360
of that

for technology which is currently empty

394
00:15:58,959 --> 00:16:00,959
we have the technology we need right now

395
00:16:00,959 --> 00:16:02,639
there's nothing

396
00:16:02,639 --> 00:16:04,079
that wall on earth is happening

397
00:16:04,079 --> 00:16:06,480
currently is wanting for technologically

398
00:16:06,480 --> 00:16:08,320
so that's a good good thing and thank

399

also check and money order is uh they're

402
00:16:14,480 --> 00:16:17,120
available as it is for enrollment in the

403
00:16:17,120 --> 00:16:19,600
how to become the true media seminar and

404
00:16:19,600 --> 00:16:21,759
uh many people have taken advantage of

405
00:16:21,759 --> 00:16:23,440
that and have enrolled that way already

406
00:16:23,440 --> 00:16:25,519
this year

407
00:16:25,519 --> 00:16:26,720
so, that's all the housekeeping

408
00:16:26,720 --> 00:16:29,360
announcements for now, let's jump into

409
00:16:29,360 --> 00:16:31,440
our main material which is the occult

410
00:16:31,440 --> 00:16:34,959
philosophy of thelema

411
00:16:34,959 --> 00:16:36,880
and

412
00:16:36,880 --> 00:16:38,480
the first thing i'm going to talk about

413
00:16:38,480 --> 00:16:41,040
is the pronunciation of thelema

414
00:16:41,040 --> 00:16:44,160
a lot of people out there say "thelima"

415
00:16:44,160 --> 00:16:45,600
i hear this all the time, because they're

416
00:16:45,600 --> 00:16:47,600
pronouncing the second "e"

417
00:16:47,600 --> 00:16:51,720
"thelema" is spelled t-h-e-l-e-m-a

418
00:16:52,320 --> 00:16:56,480
and in greek the second "e" is a long "ei"

419
00:16:56,480 --> 00:16:57,759
sound

420
00:16:57,759 --> 00:17:01,040
if you write the word thelema in greek

421
00:17:01,040 --> 00:17:05,439
it is theta, epsilon, lambda, eta

422
00:17:05,439 --> 00:17:06,400
okay

423
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:07,280
mu

424
00:17:07,280 --> 00:17:09,199
alpha

425
00:17:09,199 --> 00:17:11,919
it is not another epsilon, or it is not

426
00:17:11,919 --> 00:17:14,559
an aiota or an iota

427
00:17:14,559 --> 00:17:18,480
which would be pronounced "thelema" or "thelima"

428
00:17:18,480 --> 00:17:21,679
it is a long "ei" sound, the eta sound in

429
00:17:21,679 --> 00:17:24,160
thelema, when you see it written in greek

430
00:17:24,160 --> 00:17:26,720
as i'll have it up there in a moment

431
00:17:26,720 --> 00:17:30,160
that eta

432
00:17:30,160 --> 00:17:32,960
that's how you pronounce the

433
00:17:32,960 --> 00:17:36,160
character in ancient greek eta

434
00:17:36,160 --> 00:17:38,559
and then it is written in english as an

435
00:17:38,559 --> 00:17:39,760
"h"

436
00:17:39,760 --> 00:17:42,080
and in ancient greek eta is

437
00:17:42,080 --> 00:17:46,240
pronounced "ei", long "ei", so, without a doubt

438
00:17:46,240 --> 00:17:48,000
unequivocally

439
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:49,600
definitively

440
00:17:49,600 --> 00:17:52,000
it is correct, it is true

441
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:54,240
that the word thelema is pronounced just

442
00:17:54,240 --> 00:17:56,559
as i pronounced it - "thelema"

443
00:17:56,559 --> 00:17:59,559
okay

444
00:18:00,400 --> 00:18:02,880
i hear people who claim to be thelemites

445
00:18:02,880 --> 00:18:05,280
pronouncing it "thelima", and that's just the

446
00:18:05,280 --> 00:18:09,039
bastardization of the pronunciation

447
00:18:09,039 --> 00:18:11,679
here we're seeing the main

448
00:18:11,679 --> 00:18:14,320
symbol of the philosophy, some people

449
00:18:14,320 --> 00:18:17,520
would refer to it as a religion, i don't

450
00:18:17,520 --> 00:18:20,240
i consider it an occult philosophy, a

451
00:18:20,240 --> 00:18:22,559
philosophy that is born

452
00:18:22,559 --> 00:18:24,880
out of many other schools of

453
00:18:24,880 --> 00:18:27,120
philosophical occult thought, and other

454
00:18:27,120 --> 00:18:28,880
occultic traditions

455
00:18:28,880 --> 00:18:31,679
and sort of is an aggregate of many of

456
00:18:31,679 --> 00:18:33,520
them

457
00:18:35,120 --> 00:18:36,880
this is the symbol known as the

458
00:18:36,880 --> 00:18:39,200
unicursal hexagram

459
00:18:39,200 --> 00:18:41,600
which simply means that it is a hexagram

460
00:18:41,600 --> 00:18:42,720
or

461
00:18:42,720 --> 00:18:44,799
two interlaced

462
00:18:44,799 --> 00:18:46,799
triangles of of a sort

463
00:18:46,799 --> 00:18:49,120
representing the chalice and the blade

464
00:18:49,120 --> 00:18:51,280
the sacred feminine wed together with

465
00:18:51,280 --> 00:18:53,360
the sacred masculine

466
00:18:53,360 --> 00:18:55,440
the chalice being the sacred feminine

467
00:18:55,440 --> 00:18:56,799
womb or cup

468
00:18:56,799 --> 00:18:58,400
and then the sacred masculine being the

469
00:18:58,400 --> 00:19:00,400
blade or phallic symbol, we've talked

470
00:19:00,400 --> 00:19:02,160
about this symbolism pretty much

471
00:19:02,160 --> 00:19:04,480
endlessly on what on earth is happening

472
00:19:04,480 --> 00:19:07,600
in the early parts of the series when

473
00:19:07,600 --> 00:19:10,240
i break down symbolism

474
00:19:10,240 --> 00:19:16,559
and, by the way, this show is... is cumulative material, so, i want to say

475
00:19:16,559 --> 00:19:17,919
at the beginning of just about every

476
00:19:17,919 --> 00:19:20,000
show

477
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:21,840
you have to go back and you have to

478
00:19:21,840 --> 00:19:24,080
listen to the shows in order, this is

479
00:19:24,080 --> 00:19:26,799
episode number 251, without the benefit

480
00:19:26,799 --> 00:19:30,480
of understanding the other 250 episodes

481
00:19:30,480 --> 00:19:32,000
this show is not going to make as much

482
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:34,080
sense to you, each show of what on earth

483
00:19:34,080 --> 00:19:37,120
is happening does not stand alone

484
00:19:37,120 --> 00:19:39,120
there is prerequisite material to

485
00:19:39,120 --> 00:19:41,520
understand in the earlier episodes

486
00:19:41,520 --> 00:19:43,280
so, if you are a new viewer or listener

487
00:19:43,280 --> 00:19:45,120
you should go back to the early earliest

488
00:19:45,120 --> 00:19:47,520
episode - show number 1, and you should

489
00:19:47,520 --> 00:19:49,679
listen in order

490
00:19:49,679 --> 00:19:52,240
from 1 to 2, to 3, to 4, to 5

491
00:19:52,240 --> 00:19:53,600
etcetera

492
00:19:53,600 --> 00:19:55,280
at your own pace

493
00:19:55,280 --> 00:19:56,480
that is the only way you're going to

494
00:19:56,480 --> 00:19:59,840
gain maximum benefit and maximum clarity

495
00:19:59,840 --> 00:20:02,799
and maximum understanding of what i talk

496
00:20:02,799 --> 00:20:05,039
about here on this program

497
00:20:05,039 --> 00:20:06,400
so

498
00:20:06,400 --> 00:20:09,520
going back to the symbolism of thelema

499
00:20:09,520 --> 00:20:12,080
the unicursal hexagram

500
00:20:12,080 --> 00:20:13,840
is one of its main symbols because it

501
00:20:13,840 --> 00:20:15,360
represents

502
00:20:15,360 --> 00:20:17,200
the balancing of the sacred masculine

503
00:20:17,200 --> 00:20:19,280
and sacred feminine energies in sacred

504
00:20:19,280 --> 00:20:21,280
union

505
00:20:21,280 --> 00:20:23,039
the alchemical wedding, as it has been

506
00:20:23,039 --> 00:20:25,280
known, as it has been called in different

507
00:20:25,280 --> 00:20:28,159
occult traditions

508
00:20:28,880 --> 00:20:30,320
and

509
00:20:30,320 --> 00:20:32,640
it is

510
00:20:32,640 --> 00:20:34,000
a little bit different from the

511
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:36,320
traditional usage of the combination of

512
00:20:36,320 --> 00:20:38,480
the chalice and blade in what is known

513
00:20:38,480 --> 00:20:43,360
as the seal of solomon or the six-pointed star

514
00:20:43,600 --> 00:20:44,720
and

515
00:20:44,720 --> 00:20:46,880
aleister crowley, the founder of the

516
00:20:46,880 --> 00:20:48,799
tradition of thelema, who we will talk

517
00:20:48,799 --> 00:20:50,720
about a little bit, i'm not going to get

518
00:20:50,720 --> 00:20:52,720
very, very deeply into crowley in his

519
00:20:52,720 --> 00:20:53,679
life

520
00:20:53,679 --> 00:20:55,679
crowley, crawley, however anyone wants to

521
00:20:55,679 --> 00:20:57,600
pronounce that

522
00:20:57,600 --> 00:21:00,559
i generally pronounce it crowley, but

523
00:21:00,559 --> 00:21:02,720
we'll get into crowley in his life

524
00:21:02,720 --> 00:21:05,120
and we won't get that much into it

525
00:21:05,120 --> 00:21:07,039
i'm going to talk about how you can't

526
00:21:07,039 --> 00:21:08,559
equivalate

527
00:21:08,559 --> 00:21:11,360
crowley and thelema, crowley may be the

528
00:21:11,360 --> 00:21:14,159
founder and popularizer of the thelemic

529
00:21:14,159 --> 00:21:16,720
tradition in the world of the occult

530
00:21:16,720 --> 00:21:18,720
but he does not represent the beyond

531
00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:20,880
end-all of what thelema is, nor should

532
00:21:20,880 --> 00:21:24,000
anyone look to his life as an example

533
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:27,039
and attempt to live according to how

534
00:21:27,039 --> 00:21:29,440
crowley lived, that would be a very bad

535
00:21:29,440 --> 00:21:31,760
way of going about representing

536
00:21:31,760 --> 00:21:35,200
exploring the thelemic tradition etcetera

537
00:21:35,200 --> 00:21:37,360
so, we'll get into the

538
00:21:37,360 --> 00:21:39,919
details of that in a moment, because

539
00:21:39,919 --> 00:21:41,200
that's one of the first things people

540
00:21:41,200 --> 00:21:42,880
are going to ask, but i want to speak a

541
00:21:42,880 --> 00:21:44,640
little bit to the symbolism, since this

542
00:21:44,640 --> 00:21:46,480
is how i'm entering

543
00:21:46,480 --> 00:21:47,760
the topic

544
00:21:47,760 --> 00:21:50,080
with this slide

545
00:21:50,080 --> 00:21:52,159
crowley wanted to

546
00:21:52,159 --> 00:21:54,480
unify the chalice and the blade in a way

547
00:21:54,480 --> 00:21:56,559
that it hadn't been before

548
00:21:56,559 --> 00:21:58,159
with the seal of solomon, in which they

549
00:21:58,159 --> 00:22:00,240
are each represented separately

550
00:22:00,240 --> 00:22:02,960
they either overlap or interlock in that

551
00:22:02,960 --> 00:22:05,039
symbol

552
00:22:05,039 --> 00:22:07,200
he wanted to write it

553
00:22:07,200 --> 00:22:09,600
down on paper without picking up the

554
00:22:09,600 --> 00:22:12,400
pencil or pen that he's writing with, so

555
00:22:12,400 --> 00:22:14,480
that's what is meant by unicursal, it's

556
00:22:14,480 --> 00:22:16,799
drawn with one movement

557
00:22:16,799 --> 00:22:19,679
okay, you could draw this symbol with one

558
00:22:19,679 --> 00:22:23,120
movement, it joins itself, it's not broken

559
00:22:23,120 --> 00:22:25,520
okay, so, i'll put the cursor here, so you

560
00:22:25,520 --> 00:22:27,440
could see it, if you started in this

561
00:22:27,440 --> 00:22:28,320
corner

562
00:22:28,320 --> 00:22:30,559
you go up here to the top, and then down

563
00:22:30,559 --> 00:22:33,280
to this corner, and then over

564
00:22:33,280 --> 00:22:37,520
and then you draw then the chalice

565
00:22:37,919 --> 00:22:40,480
and then you're back where you began

566
00:22:40,480 --> 00:22:43,440
so, that's what is meant by unicursal, it

567
00:22:43,440 --> 00:22:45,600
is in one

568
00:22:45,600 --> 00:22:47,039
movement of

569
00:22:47,039 --> 00:22:50,000
the pen or pencil on the paper

570
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:51,360
and then in the middle of it, at the

571
00:22:51,360 --> 00:22:53,360
heart, and this is a point of contention

572
00:22:53,360 --> 00:22:55,600
as well, in the symbolism

573
00:22:55,600 --> 00:22:58,720
there is a five petaled flower

574
00:22:58,720 --> 00:23:00,000
some people

575
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:04,240
present this symbol inverted with the

576
00:23:05,360 --> 00:23:08,240
top point of the five-pointed petaled

577
00:23:08,240 --> 00:23:10,640
flower, five-petaled flower

578
00:23:10,640 --> 00:23:12,559
pointed down

579
00:23:12,559 --> 00:23:14,480
i don't see that as the correct

580
00:23:14,480 --> 00:23:17,039
orientation, but people argue this over

581
00:23:17,039 --> 00:23:18,960
and over again, and you will see it in

582
00:23:18,960 --> 00:23:20,840
the thelemic tradition in both

583
00:23:20,840 --> 00:23:24,320
orientations, pointed up and down

584
00:23:24,320 --> 00:23:26,159
to me, and this should be no surprise to

585
00:23:26,159 --> 00:23:29,120
anyone that knows my work

586
00:23:29,120 --> 00:23:31,120
i would say the correct orientation is

587
00:23:31,120 --> 00:23:32,000
with the

588
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:34,080
the fifth point of the pedal pointing

589
00:23:34,080 --> 00:23:35,120
upward

590
00:23:35,120 --> 00:23:37,039
because this puts

591
00:23:37,039 --> 00:23:38,559
the

592
00:23:38,559 --> 00:23:41,200
orientation of the petal of the flower

593
00:23:41,200 --> 00:23:43,520
in its correct orientation, because that

594
00:23:43,520 --> 00:23:46,159
fifth petal represents spirit

595
00:23:46,159 --> 00:23:47,440
in the

596
00:23:47,440 --> 00:23:49,600
tradition of elements alchemically, you

597
00:23:49,600 --> 00:23:52,159
have earth, air, water and fire as being

598
00:23:52,159 --> 00:23:53,840
the elements that make up the material

599
00:23:53,840 --> 00:23:54,880
plane

600
00:23:54,880 --> 00:23:56,960
and then, of course, spirit

601
00:23:56,960 --> 00:23:59,200
is the fifth element

602
00:23:59,200 --> 00:24:02,159
or you could see that as love or just

603
00:24:02,159 --> 00:24:04,240
consciousness

604
00:24:04,240 --> 00:24:07,120
and that always should be above

605
00:24:07,120 --> 00:24:10,240
the others, not in the sense that it is

606
00:24:10,240 --> 00:24:12,080
quote more important

607
00:24:12,080 --> 00:24:13,919
but it is the

608
00:24:13,919 --> 00:24:16,240
the unifying aspect of it, it is

609
00:24:16,240 --> 00:24:17,840
something that should not be in a

610
00:24:17,840 --> 00:24:20,559
downward position where the

611
00:24:20,559 --> 00:24:21,520
physical

612
00:24:21,520 --> 00:24:24,000
elements take precedence over the

613
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:26,000
spiritual

614
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:27,760
so, we talked about that a lot, when we

615
00:24:27,760 --> 00:24:30,480
talked about the five-pointed pentagram

616
00:24:30,480 --> 00:24:32,320
and how it should be always in an

617
00:24:32,320 --> 00:24:35,120
upright orientation, satanists will use

618
00:24:35,120 --> 00:24:38,320
it in the inverted orientation

619
00:24:38,320 --> 00:24:40,559
and that was going to bring us

620
00:24:40,559 --> 00:24:42,400
that kind of completes what i wanted to

621
00:24:42,400 --> 00:24:44,960
say about the unicursal hexagram and why

622
00:24:44,960 --> 00:24:47,200
it is the

623
00:24:47,200 --> 00:24:48,880
sort of foundational

624
00:24:48,880 --> 00:24:51,360
and known symbol of the thelemic

625
00:24:51,360 --> 00:24:52,400
tradition

626
00:24:52,400 --> 00:24:54,400
but in talking about the correct

627
00:24:54,400 --> 00:24:56,720
orientation of that five-petaled flower

628
00:24:56,720 --> 00:24:58,840
in the heart of the unicursal

629
00:24:58,840 --> 00:25:00,480
hexagram

630
00:25:00,480 --> 00:25:03,120
that sort of brings us to the next

631
00:25:03,120 --> 00:25:05,039
topic and point of contention, when it

632
00:25:05,039 --> 00:25:07,200
comes to thelema

633
00:25:07,200 --> 00:25:10,159
what almost everybody is going to say is

634
00:25:10,159 --> 00:25:12,799
why even discuss thelema ? why

635
00:25:12,799 --> 00:25:15,520
delve into this topic, mark ?

636
00:25:15,520 --> 00:25:17,919
isn't thelema satanism ? isn't that

637
00:25:17,919 --> 00:25:20,799
the stuff that aleister crowley was into

638
00:25:20,799 --> 00:25:23,520
and wasn't crowley himself a satanist

639
00:25:23,520 --> 00:25:26,159
almost everybody who is unfamiliar with

640
00:25:26,159 --> 00:25:28,159
the tradition of thelema and has not

641
00:25:28,159 --> 00:25:30,240
studied it in depth

642
00:25:30,240 --> 00:25:33,919
is going to come up with this very

643
00:25:33,919 --> 00:25:35,919
wording this question, these questions

644
00:25:35,919 --> 00:25:37,360
that... you know

645
00:25:37,360 --> 00:25:38,880
it's one of the first things that people

646
00:25:38,880 --> 00:25:41,120
are going to ask

647
00:25:41,120 --> 00:25:44,240
and unequivocally without a shadow of a

648
00:25:44,240 --> 00:25:45,120
doubt

649
00:25:45,120 --> 00:25:47,679
thelema is not satanism

650
00:25:47,679 --> 00:25:49,440
they are entirely different things, now

651
00:25:49,440 --> 00:25:52,000
that does not mean that

652
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:54,159
it cannot be perverted and used in a

653
00:25:54,159 --> 00:25:58,880
satanic way - is kabbalah satanism ? no it

654
00:25:58,880 --> 00:26:00,480
is not

655
00:26:00,480 --> 00:26:03,600
can kabbalah be used in a negative

656
00:26:03,600 --> 00:26:05,039
aspect

657
00:26:05,039 --> 00:26:08,159
in a satanic aspect - yes, it can

658
00:26:08,159 --> 00:26:10,799
in the dark aspect of kabbalah, that

659
00:26:10,799 --> 00:26:12,240
is

660
00:26:12,240 --> 00:26:13,600
known as

661
00:26:13,600 --> 00:26:16,000
klippoth, we've talked about that a little

662
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:18,320
bit on previous episodes of what on

663
00:26:18,320 --> 00:26:22,960
earth is happening, the klippothic kabbalah

664
00:26:22,960 --> 00:26:25,679
klippothic kabbalah

665
00:26:25,679 --> 00:26:28,000
is the inversion of true kabbalistic

666
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:29,200
tradition

667
00:26:29,200 --> 00:26:31,039
in occultism

668
00:26:31,039 --> 00:26:33,919
because, if you know this knowledge

669
00:26:33,919 --> 00:26:36,000
and you hold it, and you have a deep

670
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:39,039
understanding of it, and you wanted to

671
00:26:39,039 --> 00:26:41,039
manipulate someone that has no

672
00:26:41,039 --> 00:26:42,960
understanding of it

673
00:26:42,960 --> 00:26:45,279
that is possible to do

674
00:26:45,279 --> 00:26:49,120
if you're of that low consciousness

675
00:26:49,120 --> 00:26:49,919
so

676
00:26:49,919 --> 00:26:52,880
can kabbalah be twisted and turned around

677
00:26:52,880 --> 00:26:56,320
and turned into a satanic tradition ?

678
00:26:56,320 --> 00:26:58,640
yes

679
00:26:58,679 --> 00:27:01,760
rosicrucianism is not satanism

680
00:27:01,760 --> 00:27:03,919
however - is there a dark side to that ? yes

681
00:27:03,919 --> 00:27:05,200
there can be

682
00:27:05,200 --> 00:27:07,520
look at the people who put up

683
00:27:07,520 --> 00:27:09,520
the georgia guidestones and claim that

684
00:27:09,520 --> 00:27:13,279
the person's name was r.c. christian

685
00:27:13,279 --> 00:27:16,400
or in other words, rose-cross christian

686
00:27:16,400 --> 00:27:17,840
which is what

687
00:27:17,840 --> 00:27:25,360
a rosicrucian is - a christian of the rose-cross, rosic-crucian, rose-cross

688
00:27:27,120 --> 00:27:28,880
after the

689
00:27:28,880 --> 00:27:31,520
allegorical founder of the rose-cross

690
00:27:31,520 --> 00:27:33,360
tradition, the rosicrucian tradition

691
00:27:33,360 --> 00:27:37,360
christian rosencreutz, christian r.c.

692
00:27:37,360 --> 00:27:39,600
again, that's who the Georgia Guidestones

693
00:27:39,600 --> 00:27:42,080
which are clearly

694
00:27:42,080 --> 00:27:45,120
born of a satanic mindset

695
00:27:45,120 --> 00:27:47,440
to try to cull the population down to

696
00:27:47,440 --> 00:27:49,840
manageable numbers for the satanic

697
00:27:49,840 --> 00:27:52,240
elitists

698
00:27:52,240 --> 00:27:54,480
so, can rosicrucianism be turned around

699
00:27:54,480 --> 00:27:56,480
and made into a dark tradition ? yes, it

700
00:27:56,480 --> 00:27:57,760
can

701
00:27:57,760 --> 00:27:59,840
that does not mean there is not a pure

702
00:27:59,840 --> 00:28:01,360
unadulterated form of it, look at

703
00:28:01,360 --> 00:28:03,039
freemasonry

704
00:28:03,039 --> 00:28:06,320
we taught freemasonry for a few months

705
00:28:06,320 --> 00:28:08,240
here on what on earth is happening, in

706
00:28:08,240 --> 00:28:11,120
many episodes

707
00:28:11,360 --> 00:28:12,880
some

708
00:28:12,880 --> 00:28:15,279
high-level freemasons

709
00:28:15,279 --> 00:28:17,600
got in touch with me after those

710
00:28:17,600 --> 00:28:20,399
broadcasts, and even subsequently later

711
00:28:20,399 --> 00:28:22,240
years later

712
00:28:22,240 --> 00:28:24,240
and told me - you've taught me more

713
00:28:24,240 --> 00:28:26,559
about freemasonry than

714
00:28:26,559 --> 00:28:28,640
all my years in the lodge, and i've had

715
00:28:28,640 --> 00:28:31,360
people personally who belong to lodge

716
00:28:31,360 --> 00:28:35,279
systems of freemasonry tell me that

717
00:28:36,960 --> 00:28:38,320
because

718
00:28:38,320 --> 00:28:40,799
many of their traditions have turned

719
00:28:40,799 --> 00:28:42,640
to the dark side, they're not teaching

720
00:28:42,640 --> 00:28:44,720
the esoteric traditions of freemasonry

721
00:28:44,720 --> 00:28:46,080
they're a disgrace

722
00:28:46,080 --> 00:28:49,120
most of the lodges

723
00:28:49,279 --> 00:28:51,120
let me tell you what i want, i'm going

724
00:28:51,120 --> 00:28:52,960
off on an aside about this, because i'm

725
00:28:52,960 --> 00:28:54,960
trying to emphasize the point, first of

726
00:28:54,960 --> 00:28:58,000
all, that every occult tradition can have

727
00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:00,559
a dark side, because it's about knowledge

728
00:29:00,559 --> 00:29:02,960
and how it is used

729
00:29:02,960 --> 00:29:04,720
that does not make

730
00:29:04,720 --> 00:29:08,880
thelema satanism just because crowley, as

731
00:29:08,880 --> 00:29:10,320
a man

732
00:29:10,320 --> 00:29:11,600
failed

733
00:29:11,600 --> 00:29:14,559
to stay upon the path of thelema

734
00:29:14,559 --> 00:29:17,039
with his

735
00:29:17,039 --> 00:29:19,360
earthly self

736
00:29:19,360 --> 00:29:22,960
and his earthly will

737
00:29:23,919 --> 00:29:26,240
crowley is no more thelema, ladies and

738
00:29:26,240 --> 00:29:27,679
gentlemen

739
00:29:27,679 --> 00:29:30,240
than any worshipful master

740
00:29:30,240 --> 00:29:33,600
at a masonic lodge anywhere in the world

741
00:29:33,600 --> 00:29:36,799
is freemasonry

742
00:29:36,799 --> 00:29:39,760
crowley is no more thelema

743
00:29:39,760 --> 00:29:40,880
then

744
00:29:40,880 --> 00:29:45,600
mark passio is natural law

745
00:29:46,880 --> 00:29:48,880
what hubris i would have to have the

746
00:29:48,880 --> 00:29:50,960
claim that i am natural law, of course

747
00:29:50,960 --> 00:29:52,480
i'm not

748
00:29:52,480 --> 00:29:54,960
i can understand how it works and relate

749
00:29:54,960 --> 00:29:57,200
that to others

750
00:29:57,200 --> 00:29:59,440
but that doesn't make me that

751
00:29:59,440 --> 00:30:01,039
thing

752
00:30:01,039 --> 00:30:06,159
so, crowley is not the tradition of thelema, and anybody that insists that he is

753
00:30:06,159 --> 00:30:10,240
is sorely mistaken and or lying

754
00:30:10,240 --> 00:30:12,159
but this is the problem that happens, and

755
00:30:12,159 --> 00:30:14,320
i want to, i do want to go off on an

756
00:30:14,320 --> 00:30:16,480
aside regarding freemasonry as a matter

757
00:30:16,480 --> 00:30:18,799
of fact, crowley integrated a lot of

758
00:30:18,799 --> 00:30:20,399
different traditions into thelema

759
00:30:20,399 --> 00:30:24,000
rosicrucianism, kabbalah, of course, tarot

760
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:26,559
absolutely, i will show some of

761
00:30:26,559 --> 00:30:28,480
a couple of the tarot cards from his own

762
00:30:28,480 --> 00:30:30,559
personal deck, the thoth deck

763
00:30:30,559 --> 00:30:33,840
in this broadcast

764
00:30:34,480 --> 00:30:35,279
and

765
00:30:35,279 --> 00:30:37,840
again, he fell from the path of thelema

766
00:30:37,840 --> 00:30:40,720
and some would call that a satanic path

767
00:30:40,720 --> 00:30:43,279
he went down the left-hand path

768
00:30:43,279 --> 00:30:45,600
but that doesn't make the tradition

769
00:30:45,600 --> 00:30:48,720
and the philosophy of thelema satanic

770
00:30:48,720 --> 00:30:51,200
again, let's say, i fall from the path of

771
00:30:51,200 --> 00:30:52,559
natural law

772
00:30:52,559 --> 00:30:54,880
and that's absolutely possible, anything

773
00:30:54,880 --> 00:30:57,760
can happen in an individual's life

774
00:30:57,760 --> 00:30:59,919
that does not make

775
00:30:59,919 --> 00:31:01,600
everything i said about natural law

776
00:31:01,600 --> 00:31:03,039
invalid

777
00:31:03,039 --> 00:31:08,159
crowley, falling from the path of thelema, does not make what he said about

778
00:31:08,159 --> 00:31:10,159
what is true regarding the philosophy of

779
00:31:10,159 --> 00:31:12,080
thelema and the path of thelema

780
00:31:12,080 --> 00:31:13,519
invalid

781
00:31:13,519 --> 00:31:16,000
it just makes him an asshole, and it

782
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:17,120
makes him

783
00:31:17,120 --> 00:31:19,919
having done made poor choices in life

784
00:31:19,919 --> 00:31:23,200
and having done bad things

785
00:31:23,200 --> 00:31:26,399
that does not invalidate the philosophy

786
00:31:26,399 --> 00:31:28,880
this is a very mature mindset, that has

787
00:31:28,880 --> 00:31:31,360
to be first of all developed

788
00:31:31,360 --> 00:31:34,320
upon the part of the potential student

789
00:31:34,320 --> 00:31:36,240
of an occult tradition like thelema

790
00:31:36,240 --> 00:31:38,080
that's why i tell people

791
00:31:38,080 --> 00:31:40,159
this is last in the line

792
00:31:40,159 --> 00:31:41,039
you know

793
00:31:41,039 --> 00:31:43,600
study simpler occult traditions, i like

794
00:31:43,600 --> 00:31:45,840
to tell people - study the tarot, honestly

795
00:31:45,840 --> 00:31:46,960
if you're going to delve into an occult

796
00:31:46,960 --> 00:31:48,960
tradition first, when you know nothing

797
00:31:48,960 --> 00:31:51,760
about it, the symbolism of the tarot is

798
00:31:51,760 --> 00:31:53,519
very neutral

799
00:31:53,519 --> 00:31:56,559
and when you decode it - it teaches such

800
00:31:56,559 --> 00:31:58,960
wonderful things that

801
00:31:58,960 --> 00:32:00,640
it's a great place to start, as far as

802
00:32:00,640 --> 00:32:02,159
i'm concerned, it can

803
00:32:02,159 --> 00:32:02,960
get

804
00:32:02,960 --> 00:32:04,080
somewhat

805
00:32:04,080 --> 00:32:05,760
involved and

806
00:32:05,760 --> 00:32:08,880
complicated too, as well, but that just

807
00:32:08,880 --> 00:32:10,480
challenges your mind

808
00:32:10,480 --> 00:32:12,840
kabbalah is the same way, there's so many

809
00:32:12,840 --> 00:32:15,760
different symbolic, you know

810
00:32:15,760 --> 00:32:18,399
overtones to it, tons of symbolism

811
00:32:18,399 --> 00:32:19,519
wording

812
00:32:19,519 --> 00:32:21,440
cross-correlations, you need

813
00:32:21,440 --> 00:32:24,960
correlative thinking to understand it

814
00:32:24,960 --> 00:32:27,039
and it challenges the mind, and it brings

815
00:32:27,039 --> 00:32:29,360
the brain hemispheres into unison with

816
00:32:29,360 --> 00:32:30,320
each other

817
00:32:30,320 --> 00:32:33,120
gets them firing on all cylinders

818
00:32:33,120 --> 00:32:34,720
that's why i love the kabbalistic

819
00:32:34,720 --> 00:32:36,399
tradition, that's why

820
00:32:36,399 --> 00:32:38,960
when i decided what occult traditions am

821
00:32:38,960 --> 00:32:40,880
i going to really teach in earnest here

822
00:32:40,880 --> 00:32:43,120
on what on earth is happening - tarot and

823
00:32:43,120 --> 00:32:45,600
kabbalah were two of the first that

824
00:32:45,600 --> 00:32:47,360
needed to be studied in conjunction with

825
00:32:47,360 --> 00:32:49,279
each other

826
00:32:49,279 --> 00:32:51,840
that's very true of thelema, you're not

827
00:32:51,840 --> 00:32:53,279
going to understand the thelemic

828
00:32:53,279 --> 00:32:54,720
tradition without

829
00:32:54,720 --> 00:32:56,720
a firm foundation in other forms of

830
00:32:56,720 --> 00:32:59,519
occultism such as tarot, kabbalah

831
00:32:59,519 --> 00:33:01,679
freemasonry and rosicrucianism

832
00:33:01,679 --> 00:33:04,320
especially

833
00:33:04,720 --> 00:33:06,640
so, let's clear up this question once and

834
00:33:06,640 --> 00:33:09,360
for all, and get that out of the way

835
00:33:09,360 --> 00:33:11,200
you could say - crowley fell from the

836
00:33:11,200 --> 00:33:13,679
thelemic path and lived a satanic

837
00:33:13,679 --> 00:33:15,200
lifestyle for

838
00:33:15,200 --> 00:33:18,240
a good amount of time

839
00:33:18,240 --> 00:33:23,440
but do not equate crowley with thelema

840
00:33:23,440 --> 00:33:25,440
once again, we have to

841
00:33:25,440 --> 00:33:28,960
take the very adult

842
00:33:29,760 --> 00:33:32,480
perspective

843
00:33:32,480 --> 00:33:33,200
and

844
00:33:33,200 --> 00:33:36,480
attempt to separate the human being

845
00:33:36,480 --> 00:33:38,559
from the information that they espouse

846
00:33:38,559 --> 00:33:40,159
or that they are talking about, or that

847
00:33:40,159 --> 00:33:41,919
they are trying to communicate

848
00:33:41,919 --> 00:33:44,880
so, people may not like mark passio, and

849
00:33:44,880 --> 00:33:46,640
that's fine

850
00:33:46,640 --> 00:33:49,200
i'm not required to be liked, i don't

851
00:33:49,200 --> 00:33:52,960
require anyone to like me

852
00:33:52,960 --> 00:33:54,159
but

853
00:33:54,159 --> 00:33:55,919
is what i'm saying about natural law

854
00:33:55,919 --> 00:33:58,799
true ? yes, it is

855
00:33:58,799 --> 00:34:00,399
so

856
00:34:00,399 --> 00:34:01,519
again

857
00:34:01,519 --> 00:34:04,000
crowley is no more

858
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:05,919
the equivalent to thelema than mark

859
00:34:05,919 --> 00:34:08,079
passio is the equivalent to natural law

860
00:34:08,079 --> 00:34:10,159
if you don't like hearing about natural

861
00:34:10,159 --> 00:34:11,918
law from mark passio you'll go learn about

862
00:34:11,918 --> 00:34:15,559
it from someone else

863
00:34:20,320 --> 00:34:21,839
so

864
00:34:21,839 --> 00:34:23,280
this is the first thing that has to be

865
00:34:23,280 --> 00:34:24,960
understood is

866
00:34:24,960 --> 00:34:26,960
you have to take the person

867
00:34:26,960 --> 00:34:30,399
separately from the tradition

868
00:34:30,639 --> 00:34:33,960
look at freemasonry

869
00:34:34,719 --> 00:34:36,159
can you

870
00:34:36,159 --> 00:34:37,679
simply

871
00:34:37,679 --> 00:34:39,040
attribute

872
00:34:39,040 --> 00:34:41,280
all of the freemasonic tradition and

873
00:34:41,280 --> 00:34:43,918
all of the philosophy contained therein

874
00:34:43,918 --> 00:34:46,320
to the lodge system ?

875
00:34:46,320 --> 00:34:49,679
the lodge system is not freemasonry

876
00:34:49,679 --> 00:34:51,599
this is why i've told people in studying

877
00:34:51,599 --> 00:34:53,280
freemasonry and in exploring it, and

878
00:34:53,280 --> 00:34:54,639
teaching it

879
00:34:54,639 --> 00:34:56,800
you don't need the lodge system

880
00:34:56,800 --> 00:35:00,320
the lodge system is largely junk today

881
00:35:00,320 --> 00:35:02,800
however, i want to make an aside on this

882
00:35:02,800 --> 00:35:04,480
very point

883
00:35:04,480 --> 00:35:07,200
and especially talking about freemasonry

884
00:35:07,200 --> 00:35:09,680
which is definitely a

885
00:35:09,680 --> 00:35:14,960
a simpatico influence with thelema

886
00:35:15,520 --> 00:35:17,680
i would personally like to be able to

887
00:35:17,680 --> 00:35:20,079
teach inside the freemasonic lodge

888
00:35:20,079 --> 00:35:23,200
system, so, i'm going to put this

889
00:35:23,200 --> 00:35:24,400
idea

890
00:35:24,400 --> 00:35:26,240
offer, however you want to look at it out

891
00:35:26,240 --> 00:35:28,320
there

892
00:35:28,320 --> 00:35:31,760
if a worshipful master of their lodge

893
00:35:31,760 --> 00:35:33,119
anywhere

894
00:35:33,119 --> 00:35:34,800
in the world

895
00:35:34,800 --> 00:35:38,320
wishes to confer upon me the honorary

896
00:35:38,320 --> 00:35:41,520
33rd degree of freemasonry

897
00:35:41,520 --> 00:35:43,359
i would

898
00:35:43,359 --> 00:35:45,839
graciously accept that

899
00:35:45,839 --> 00:35:48,880
conference of the 33rd degree

900
00:35:48,880 --> 00:35:51,839
because and, quite frankly, i feel that it

901
00:35:51,839 --> 00:35:53,200
should be done

902
00:35:53,200 --> 00:35:54,960
and i'm not, i'm not

903
00:35:54,960 --> 00:35:57,520
i'm not directly even like asking or

904
00:35:57,520 --> 00:35:59,440
begging for that, i'm saying - i think it

905
00:35:59,440 --> 00:36:01,359
should be done for a reason, for a

906
00:36:01,359 --> 00:36:03,520
specific reason

907
00:36:03,520 --> 00:36:06,400
the lodge system of freemasonry is in

908
00:36:06,400 --> 00:36:08,320
absolute

909
00:36:08,320 --> 00:36:09,359
junk

910
00:36:09,359 --> 00:36:10,960
disarray

911
00:36:10,960 --> 00:36:12,880
anybody, who

912
00:36:12,880 --> 00:36:15,440
even speaks with anybody within the

913
00:36:15,440 --> 00:36:17,760
systems of freemasonry at work today in

914
00:36:17,760 --> 00:36:20,480
the world, not only knows this, they know

915
00:36:20,480 --> 00:36:23,280
it's way worse than what i'm saying

916
00:36:23,280 --> 00:36:25,680
and you know, you know this

917
00:36:25,680 --> 00:36:27,520
if you don't know it

918
00:36:27,520 --> 00:36:29,599
you're just dumb, son

919
00:36:29,599 --> 00:36:30,480
okay

920
00:36:30,480 --> 00:36:31,920
you should know it if you're

921
00:36:31,920 --> 00:36:35,359
involved in any capacity

922
00:36:35,520 --> 00:36:36,400
so

923
00:36:36,400 --> 00:36:40,400
my kind of idea and or offer for the

924
00:36:40,400 --> 00:36:43,200
lodge system is

925
00:36:43,200 --> 00:36:45,119
if

926
00:36:45,119 --> 00:36:48,640
a worshipful master of a current lodge, a

927
00:36:48,640 --> 00:36:51,520
current worshipful master were to make

928
00:36:51,520 --> 00:36:52,800
me

929
00:36:52,800 --> 00:36:55,599
were to confer upon me the 33rd honorary

930
00:36:55,599 --> 00:36:56,640
degree

931
00:36:56,640 --> 00:36:58,720
for what i have taught regarding

932
00:36:58,720 --> 00:37:01,520
freemasonry during my

933
00:37:01,520 --> 00:37:04,079
career in broadcasting on what on earth

934
00:37:04,079 --> 00:37:06,720
is happening and the other lectures that

935
00:37:06,720 --> 00:37:10,400
i've given in presentations i've done

936
00:37:12,640 --> 00:37:14,560
for the clarification

937
00:37:14,560 --> 00:37:16,960
that i have given to the freemasonic

938
00:37:16,960 --> 00:37:18,160
tradition

939
00:37:18,160 --> 00:37:19,680
and, also, even

940
00:37:19,680 --> 00:37:21,520
helping people to separate it from the

941
00:37:21,520 --> 00:37:23,599
lodge system

942
00:37:23,599 --> 00:37:24,880
once again

943
00:37:24,880 --> 00:37:26,320
crowley is no

944
00:37:26,320 --> 00:37:27,920
more thelema

945
00:37:27,920 --> 00:37:31,359
than the lodge system is freemasonry

946
00:37:31,359 --> 00:37:33,200
they cannot be

947
00:37:33,200 --> 00:37:35,280
considered equivalents of each other

948
00:37:35,280 --> 00:37:37,520
they are not equal to each other, okay

949
00:37:37,520 --> 00:37:39,119
that's the sign there

950
00:37:39,119 --> 00:37:40,880
on the

951
00:37:40,880 --> 00:37:43,599
slide there for not equal to

952
00:37:43,599 --> 00:37:46,400
crowley is not equal to thelema

953
00:37:46,400 --> 00:37:48,800
the lodge system is not equal to

954
00:37:48,800 --> 00:37:51,920
freemasonry, mark passio is not equal to

955
00:37:51,920 --> 00:37:54,560
natural law

956
00:37:55,440 --> 00:37:58,079
you have to separate human beings from

957
00:37:58,079 --> 00:38:00,720
philosophical understanding and ideas

958
00:38:00,720 --> 00:38:03,839
they're not equivalent

959
00:38:03,839 --> 00:38:06,160
and that's discernment, that comes with

960
00:38:06,160 --> 00:38:07,760
discernment

961
00:38:07,760 --> 00:38:09,920
once again, this show's gonna fly over

962
00:38:09,920 --> 00:38:12,240
most people's heads, i'm gonna lose most

963
00:38:12,240 --> 00:38:13,119
people

964
00:38:13,119 --> 00:38:14,560
and that's okay, it's not meant for

965
00:38:14,560 --> 00:38:16,400
everybody, it's not meant for most people

966
00:38:16,400 --> 00:38:18,079
it's meant for the people they're going

967
00:38:18,079 --> 00:38:20,000
to exercise the discernment to really

968
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:22,320
hear what i'm saying and get it

969
00:38:22,320 --> 00:38:25,040
but going back to this idea of

970
00:38:25,040 --> 00:38:27,280
if i were to be conferred the honorary

971
00:38:27,280 --> 00:38:30,880
33rd degree of freemasonry without

972
00:38:30,880 --> 00:38:34,079
even entering the lodge system like was

973
00:38:34,079 --> 00:38:37,440
done for manly p. hall

974
00:38:37,520 --> 00:38:39,119
like was done for

975
00:38:39,119 --> 00:38:42,079
many other people who the 33rd honorary

976
00:38:42,079 --> 00:38:44,400
degree was conferred to

977
00:38:44,400 --> 00:38:46,960
what it would make possible

978
00:38:46,960 --> 00:38:49,599
is i, as an individual

979
00:38:49,599 --> 00:38:51,520
would then be able to walk into any

980
00:38:51,520 --> 00:38:54,160
lodge system anywhere in the world

981
00:38:54,160 --> 00:38:56,640
any lodge system in the world

982
00:38:56,640 --> 00:38:58,960
i would be able to walk into

983
00:38:58,960 --> 00:39:01,119
make an agreement or arrangement with

984
00:39:01,119 --> 00:39:03,359
people who want to improve their lodge

985
00:39:03,359 --> 00:39:04,320
system

986
00:39:04,320 --> 00:39:06,400
by teaching natural law

987
00:39:06,400 --> 00:39:08,560
and i could go into those environments

988
00:39:08,560 --> 00:39:10,640
and potentially teach

989
00:39:10,640 --> 00:39:13,599
an entire class on natural law

990
00:39:13,599 --> 00:39:16,320
for one of the lodge meetings

991
00:39:16,320 --> 00:39:18,320
and i'd be willing to do that, i would

992
00:39:18,320 --> 00:39:21,920
be willing to offer of my time

993
00:39:21,920 --> 00:39:24,160
in that capacity to make

994
00:39:26,240 --> 00:39:29,520
extra special one-of-a-kind slide

995
00:39:29,520 --> 00:39:32,000
presentation specifically

996
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:33,839
about the esoteric tradition of

997
00:39:33,839 --> 00:39:36,400
freemasonry, its symbolism

998
00:39:36,400 --> 00:39:38,079
its allegories

999
00:39:38,079 --> 00:39:41,599
and burst that onto the minds of the

1000
00:39:41,599 --> 00:39:43,440
people in the lodge system, that perhaps

1001
00:39:43,440 --> 00:39:46,160
are not getting it within the teachings

1002
00:39:46,160 --> 00:39:48,720
of the lodge, and i know they're not, and

1003
00:39:48,720 --> 00:39:50,640
the people out there listening to me, who

1004
00:39:50,640 --> 00:39:52,400
are involved in that in those lodge

1005
00:39:52,400 --> 00:39:53,480
systems

1006
00:39:53,480 --> 00:39:55,920
absolutely no, they're not getting it to

1007
00:39:55,920 --> 00:39:58,320
the extent that they need

1008
00:39:58,320 --> 00:40:00,320
because i've known a lot of freemasons

1009
00:40:00,320 --> 00:40:01,599
over the years, and they've all told me

1010
00:40:01,599 --> 00:40:03,599
the exact same thing, and none of it's

1011
00:40:03,599 --> 00:40:05,520
getting any better

1012
00:40:05,520 --> 00:40:07,680
it's been actually declining and getting

1013
00:40:07,680 --> 00:40:09,200
rapidly worse

1014
00:40:09,200 --> 00:40:12,480
as things continue to go on, as more and

1015
00:40:12,480 --> 00:40:15,280
more influence of political systems and

1016
00:40:15,280 --> 00:40:17,119
financial systems come into place, and

1017
00:40:17,119 --> 00:40:18,880
into that whole

1018
00:40:18,880 --> 00:40:22,960
networking arena of the lodge system

1019
00:40:22,960 --> 00:40:26,160
so, my offer - it's an offer of my time

1020
00:40:26,160 --> 00:40:28,319
and knowledge

1021
00:40:28,319 --> 00:40:30,560
and the way that i do things

1022
00:40:30,560 --> 00:40:32,000
and my aesthetic

1023
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:34,880
that i can bring to the table

1024
00:40:34,880 --> 00:40:38,800
in a presentation format

1025
00:40:38,800 --> 00:40:40,880
if someone in, who is a worshipable

1026
00:40:40,880 --> 00:40:42,640
master of their lodge, wants to confer

1027
00:40:42,640 --> 00:40:45,599
the honorary 33rd degree upon me

1028
00:40:45,599 --> 00:40:47,920
i will teach in

1029
00:40:47,920 --> 00:40:48,640
the

1030
00:40:48,640 --> 00:40:50,480
lodge system

1031
00:40:50,480 --> 00:40:53,839
wherever someone wants to have me

1032
00:40:53,839 --> 00:40:56,560
to help

1033
00:40:56,560 --> 00:40:58,640
more deeply

1034
00:40:58,640 --> 00:40:59,599
the

1035
00:40:59,599 --> 00:41:02,480
members of that lodge understand the

1036
00:41:02,480 --> 00:41:05,359
allegorical and symbolic aspects of

1037
00:41:05,359 --> 00:41:07,599
esoteric masonry

1038
00:41:07,599 --> 00:41:10,160
esoteric freemasonry

1039
00:41:10,160 --> 00:41:12,800
so, i just want to put that out there

1040
00:41:12,800 --> 00:41:15,040
but

1041
00:41:15,040 --> 00:41:18,960
going back to this concept is

1042
00:41:19,839 --> 00:41:23,520
people have to stop

1043
00:41:23,680 --> 00:41:26,160
taking the mindset of

1044
00:41:26,160 --> 00:41:27,839
i've heard really bad things about this

1045
00:41:27,839 --> 00:41:30,000
person, that person, the other person, so

1046
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:31,280
i'm not going to look into the

1047
00:41:31,280 --> 00:41:33,440
philosophy at all

1048
00:41:33,440 --> 00:41:35,680
let me tell you exactly what that is, and

1049
00:41:35,680 --> 00:41:36,960
exactly what you're playing into the

1050
00:41:36,960 --> 00:41:38,400
hands of

1051
00:41:38,400 --> 00:41:39,839
you're playing into the hands of the

1052
00:41:39,839 --> 00:41:42,400
dark occultists by doing that

1053
00:41:42,400 --> 00:41:44,640
the satanists and the dark occultists

1054
00:41:44,640 --> 00:41:47,280
want exactly that

1055
00:41:47,280 --> 00:41:49,440
let me say that again, so, you fully

1056
00:41:49,440 --> 00:41:51,280
understand this

1057
00:41:51,280 --> 00:41:53,280
the satanists and the dark occultists

1058
00:41:53,280 --> 00:41:55,280
who are really running the world, want

1059
00:41:55,280 --> 00:41:57,520
that exact position, they want that

1060
00:41:57,520 --> 00:42:00,079
exact mindset to take place in people's

1061
00:42:00,079 --> 00:42:01,760
minds, because they don't want you

1062
00:42:01,760 --> 00:42:03,359
understanding thelema, they don't want

1063
00:42:03,359 --> 00:42:04,960
you understanding tarot, they don't want

1064
00:42:04,960 --> 00:42:06,800
you understanding rosicrucianism, they

1065
00:42:06,800 --> 00:42:08,400
don't want you understanding freemasonry

1066
00:42:08,400 --> 00:42:09,440
they don't want you understanding

1067
00:42:09,440 --> 00:42:12,079
kabbalah

1068
00:42:12,079 --> 00:42:13,280
they certainly don't want you

1069
00:42:13,280 --> 00:42:15,520
understanding thelema, because thelema

1070
00:42:15,520 --> 00:42:17,520
could be

1071
00:42:17,520 --> 00:42:19,760
the concrescence and

1072
00:42:19,760 --> 00:42:22,079
aggregate combined expression of all the

1073
00:42:22,079 --> 00:42:23,760
occult traditions that have come before

1074
00:42:23,760 --> 00:42:25,119
it

1075
00:42:25,119 --> 00:42:26,960
i consider it one of the most advanced

1076
00:42:26,960 --> 00:42:30,000
occult philosophies personally

1077
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:33,200
i consider that, when i really, really

1078
00:42:33,200 --> 00:42:35,599
deeply understood thelema

1079
00:42:35,599 --> 00:42:37,119
and what it was really trying to teach

1080
00:42:37,119 --> 00:42:39,200
philosophically

1081
00:42:39,200 --> 00:42:42,720
my consciousness expanded so greatly at

1082
00:42:42,720 --> 00:42:45,280
that point, and i got so many things, that

1083
00:42:45,280 --> 00:42:47,440
i didn't get with clarity and with

1084
00:42:47,440 --> 00:42:49,760
precision previously, until i really

1085
00:42:49,760 --> 00:42:52,400
understood thelema

1086
00:42:52,400 --> 00:42:55,119
so, it's been a profound difference maker

1087
00:42:55,119 --> 00:42:56,839
for me, in my

1088
00:42:56,839 --> 00:42:59,119
life, and, i think, it can be another

1089
00:42:59,119 --> 00:43:01,680
persons' lives if they learn how to

1090
00:43:01,680 --> 00:43:04,640
separate crowley from the true thelemic

1091
00:43:04,640 --> 00:43:06,160
philosophy

1092
00:43:06,160 --> 00:43:07,680
if you could bring that discernment to

1093
00:43:07,680 --> 00:43:10,480
the table as an adult thinker

1094
00:43:10,480 --> 00:43:11,839
and do that

1095
00:43:11,839 --> 00:43:15,119
without just single-mindedly focusing on

1096
00:43:15,119 --> 00:43:17,200
crowley's deeds in life

1097
00:43:17,200 --> 00:43:19,280
which, once again

1098
00:43:19,280 --> 00:43:21,440
no one is telling you to emulate

1099
00:43:21,440 --> 00:43:24,800
that is the last thing i would ever do

1100
00:43:24,800 --> 00:43:26,400
you do not want to live like this guy

1101
00:43:26,400 --> 00:43:28,000
live, you do not want to do some of

1102
00:43:28,000 --> 00:43:30,240
the things this guy did

1103
00:43:30,240 --> 00:43:32,640
he was a gray

1104
00:43:32,640 --> 00:43:35,040
occultist at best

1105
00:43:35,040 --> 00:43:38,000
certainly, not a a light occultist

1106
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:40,640
was definitely an elitist

1107
00:43:40,640 --> 00:43:42,560
definitely worked for intelligence

1108
00:43:42,560 --> 00:43:46,079
agencies, while he was alive

1109
00:43:46,160 --> 00:43:49,440
i believe long term he did want

1110
00:43:49,440 --> 00:43:51,680
true freedom to express

1111
00:43:51,680 --> 00:43:53,359
however

1112
00:43:53,359 --> 00:43:55,839
his behaviors were not in alignment with

1113
00:43:55,839 --> 00:43:58,079
that

1114
00:43:58,319 --> 00:43:59,359
and

1115
00:43:59,359 --> 00:44:00,319
he did

1116
00:44:00,319 --> 00:44:02,319
many unsavory things

1117
00:44:02,319 --> 00:44:03,040
that

1118
00:44:03,040 --> 00:44:05,760
i would never tell you to emulate or use

1119
00:44:05,760 --> 00:44:09,119
his life example as a guide

1120
00:44:09,119 --> 00:44:11,200
certainly, don't use the man as a life

1121
00:44:11,200 --> 00:44:12,400
example

1122
00:44:12,400 --> 00:44:13,359
it's

1123
00:44:13,359 --> 00:44:14,800
the idea of

1124
00:44:14,800 --> 00:44:17,359
do as he said, not as he did

1125
00:44:17,359 --> 00:44:19,920
because his writings are profound, and

1126
00:44:19,920 --> 00:44:22,720
deeply spiritually awakening if one

1127
00:44:22,720 --> 00:44:25,359
understands them

1128
00:44:25,359 --> 00:44:27,040
he wrote in a lot of code, he wrote in a

1129
00:44:27,040 --> 00:44:28,480
lot of cipher, he wrote in a lot of

1130
00:44:28,480 --> 00:44:31,280
numerology, and a lot of allegory, he

1131
00:44:31,280 --> 00:44:33,119
wanted to encode it, because he wanted

1132
00:44:33,119 --> 00:44:37,040
people to work for the understanding

1133
00:44:37,040 --> 00:44:39,280
so, everything was a symbol, everything

1134
00:44:39,280 --> 00:44:41,839
was, you know, an array of numbers and

1135
00:44:41,839 --> 00:44:44,560
meaning, you know, a correlation

1136
00:44:44,560 --> 00:44:46,319
correlative meaning

1137
00:44:46,319 --> 00:44:48,240
he didn't want to explain things

1138
00:44:48,240 --> 00:44:50,560
straight out to de-occult them, see, that's

1139
00:44:50,560 --> 00:44:52,000
what we're doing here on what on earth

1140
00:44:52,000 --> 00:44:53,119
is happening

1141
00:44:53,119 --> 00:44:57,119
this is a de-occulting broadcast

1142
00:44:57,119 --> 00:44:59,119
crowley still wanted the information

1143
00:44:59,119 --> 00:45:01,119
occulted and kept for

1144
00:45:01,119 --> 00:45:01,920
the

1145
00:45:01,920 --> 00:45:05,359
initiates, who he felt deserved it

1146
00:45:05,359 --> 00:45:07,760
he was still of that hermetic mindset

1147
00:45:07,760 --> 00:45:08,720
right

1148
00:45:08,720 --> 00:45:11,359
again, hermeticism, we could look at that

1149
00:45:11,359 --> 00:45:12,640
tradition, you can look at that

1150
00:45:12,640 --> 00:45:14,800
philosophy, which is wonderful

1151
00:45:14,800 --> 00:45:16,880
but is there a dark side to the hermetic

1152
00:45:16,880 --> 00:45:19,920
tradition ? yes, there is

1153
00:45:19,920 --> 00:45:21,520
if you don't understand that - you don't

1154
00:45:21,520 --> 00:45:23,599
understand the occult, the occult is a

1155
00:45:23,599 --> 00:45:26,240
dual-edged sword of knowledge, it can cut

1156
00:45:26,240 --> 00:45:28,160
both ways

1157
00:45:28,160 --> 00:45:29,920
and even something like hermeticism

1158
00:45:29,920 --> 00:45:31,119
which people

1159
00:45:31,119 --> 00:45:33,280
somehow insist was the one that remained

1160
00:45:33,280 --> 00:45:35,119
pure throughout the ages

1161
00:45:35,119 --> 00:45:37,200
can be turned into a dark tradition, and

1162
00:45:37,200 --> 00:45:40,560
an elitist tradition

1163
00:45:40,800 --> 00:45:43,359
they didn't get the job done

1164
00:45:43,359 --> 00:45:44,240
right ?

1165
00:45:44,240 --> 00:45:46,720
did the rosicrucians get the job done ?

1166
00:45:46,720 --> 00:45:48,880
is humanity free

1167
00:45:48,880 --> 00:45:50,560
as a result of the rosicrucians putting

1168
00:45:50,560 --> 00:45:52,720
their knowledge out into the world ?

1169
00:45:52,720 --> 00:45:54,560
is humanity free as a result of what

1170
00:45:54,560 --> 00:45:56,400
crowley did with thelema ? is humanity

1171
00:45:56,400 --> 00:45:58,160
free what the lodge system has done with

1172
00:45:58,160 --> 00:46:00,400
freemasonry ?

1173
00:46:00,400 --> 00:46:02,240
is humanity free

1174
00:46:02,240 --> 00:46:03,920
as a result of what the hermeticists did

1175
00:46:03,920 --> 00:46:05,119
with the hermetic tradition and

1176
00:46:05,119 --> 00:46:07,200
philosophy ? no

1177
00:46:07,200 --> 00:46:09,440
all of them fell short, all of them

1178
00:46:09,440 --> 00:46:11,359
failed

1179
00:46:11,359 --> 00:46:13,200
that doesn't mean we shouldn't study the

1180
00:46:13,200 --> 00:46:14,400
traditions, that doesn't mean we

1181
00:46:14,400 --> 00:46:17,119
shouldn't separate the people from the

1182
00:46:17,119 --> 00:46:18,880
traditions and the philosophy that they

1183
00:46:18,880 --> 00:46:21,440
espoused

1184
00:46:21,920 --> 00:46:24,240
and it means that clearly

1185
00:46:24,240 --> 00:46:26,400
higher level understanding and knowledge

1186
00:46:26,400 --> 00:46:27,680
that needs to be built on those

1187
00:46:27,680 --> 00:46:29,680
foundations is required, and that's part

1188
00:46:29,680 --> 00:46:31,440
of what i'm attempting to do with what

1189
00:46:31,440 --> 00:46:33,119
on earth is happening, and have been

1190
00:46:33,119 --> 00:46:34,800
since day one

1191
00:46:34,800 --> 00:46:36,880
and, also, trying to teach people the way

1192
00:46:36,880 --> 00:46:38,560
that people have gone about teaching the

1193
00:46:38,560 --> 00:46:41,839
occult has failed, it has not resulted in

1194
00:46:41,839 --> 00:46:44,319
human freedom, we are deeper in bondage

1195
00:46:44,319 --> 00:46:47,359
than we were before

1196
00:46:47,359 --> 00:46:49,280
and then people want to still insist - we

1197
00:46:49,280 --> 00:46:51,280
gotta keep this information from people

1198
00:46:51,280 --> 00:46:53,440
that don't deserve it - wrong

1199
00:46:53,440 --> 00:46:55,200
it needs to be made common sense

1200
00:46:55,200 --> 00:46:57,680
knowledge in an egalitarian fashion

1201
00:46:57,680 --> 00:46:59,280
meaning it's out there for anyone who

1202
00:46:59,280 --> 00:47:01,520
wants it, and nobody holds it back from

1203
00:47:01,520 --> 00:47:03,200
anybody else and considers themselves

1204
00:47:03,200 --> 00:47:05,599
the gatekeepers or the holders of

1205
00:47:05,599 --> 00:47:06,800
that knowledge

1206
00:47:06,800 --> 00:47:09,440
until they deem other people

1207
00:47:09,440 --> 00:47:12,079
fit for it

1208
00:47:12,560 --> 00:47:14,480
crowley was an elitist like that, and i'm

1209
00:47:14,480 --> 00:47:16,000
sure he took that from the hermetic

1210
00:47:16,000 --> 00:47:18,480
tradition

1211
00:47:22,640 --> 00:47:24,559
and it's a mistake

1212
00:47:24,559 --> 00:47:27,280
it was a mistake thousands of years ago

1213
00:47:27,280 --> 00:47:28,960
it was a mistake when crowley did it in

1214
00:47:28,960 --> 00:47:30,800
the early 1900s

1215
00:47:30,800 --> 00:47:33,200
and it's a mistake now to anybody still

1216
00:47:33,200 --> 00:47:35,040
doing that

1217
00:47:35,040 --> 00:47:37,200
ridiculous

1218
00:47:37,200 --> 00:47:39,599
mindset of saying that this knowledge

1219
00:47:39,599 --> 00:47:42,319
should be held for an elite few

1220
00:47:42,319 --> 00:47:44,400
absolutely incorrect

1221
00:47:44,400 --> 00:47:46,160
it should be distributed widely and

1222
00:47:46,160 --> 00:47:47,839
freely, and made available for all, so

1223
00:47:47,839 --> 00:47:49,599
that it can

1224
00:47:49,599 --> 00:47:51,839
become common sense, and that's the only

1225
00:47:51,839 --> 00:47:53,680
way humanity is going to become free is

1226
00:47:53,680 --> 00:47:56,240
when this knowledge becomes common sense

1227
00:47:56,240 --> 00:47:58,160
once again

1228
00:47:58,160 --> 00:48:00,480
or, perhaps, for the first time in human

1229
00:48:00,480 --> 00:48:01,760
history

1230
00:48:01,760 --> 00:48:06,119
probably, more accurate to say

1231
00:48:06,160 --> 00:48:08,000
so, then if crowley isn't thelema then

1232
00:48:08,000 --> 00:48:09,760
what is thelema ?

1233
00:48:09,760 --> 00:48:13,760
thelema spelled in the greek

1234
00:48:13,760 --> 00:48:17,440
theta, epsilon, lambda

1235
00:48:17,440 --> 00:48:19,920
and this is incorrect here, i have to

1236
00:48:19,920 --> 00:48:21,839
correct this, i

1237
00:48:21,839 --> 00:48:24,480
said it myself, that it was...

1238
00:48:24,480 --> 00:48:26,800
there it is, that is how it is spelled

1239
00:48:26,800 --> 00:48:28,960
i apologize for that, let me see if i

1240
00:48:28,960 --> 00:48:30,559
have that incorrect

1241
00:48:30,559 --> 00:48:32,079
anywhere else, because i'm gonna have to

1242
00:48:32,079 --> 00:48:35,200
fix it

1243
00:48:35,200 --> 00:48:37,359
i want to just quickly fix that where i

1244
00:48:37,359 --> 00:48:39,119
made the error in there putting an

1245
00:48:39,119 --> 00:48:41,760
epsilon myself, so, i'm i was thinking

1246
00:48:41,760 --> 00:48:45,200
about it, and that's what made me do it

1247
00:48:45,200 --> 00:48:46,640
i just want to make sure i don't have

1248
00:48:46,640 --> 00:48:49,839
that like that anywhere else

1249
00:48:50,319 --> 00:48:52,160
let me step out of the slides real quick

1250
00:48:52,160 --> 00:48:54,079
to just go

1251
00:48:54,079 --> 00:48:56,319
correct that, so

1252
00:48:56,319 --> 00:48:58,880
yeah, let's... that now, that i'm bringing

1253
00:48:58,880 --> 00:49:00,240
it up in greek, i'm just going to step

1254
00:49:00,240 --> 00:49:01,440
through the slides and just make sure, i

1255
00:49:01,440 --> 00:49:03,520
don't have that error anywhere else, i

1256
00:49:03,520 --> 00:49:05,520
don't believe that i do, it looks like

1257
00:49:05,520 --> 00:49:07,440
everywhere else that it was written

1258
00:49:07,440 --> 00:49:09,200
it is correct

1259
00:49:09,200 --> 00:49:12,240
so, let me make sure, yeah... yep yep

1260
00:49:12,240 --> 00:49:13,920
everywhere else in the presentation it's

1261
00:49:13,920 --> 00:49:14,960
correct

1262
00:49:14,960 --> 00:49:17,760
so, just on those two slides i had it

1263
00:49:17,760 --> 00:49:18,960
spelled

1264
00:49:18,960 --> 00:49:21,280
with an epsilon, so, let's

1265
00:49:21,280 --> 00:49:23,839
jump back

1266
00:49:24,640 --> 00:49:27,839
i apologize for that

1267
00:49:28,319 --> 00:49:31,119
alright

1268
00:49:31,119 --> 00:49:33,760
there is the correct spelling, so

1269
00:49:33,760 --> 00:49:35,520
this is written in the ancient greek

1270
00:49:35,520 --> 00:49:36,720
characters

1271
00:49:36,720 --> 00:49:39,359
that's a capital theta at the

1272
00:49:39,359 --> 00:49:41,040
beginning

1273
00:49:41,040 --> 00:49:44,960
then epsilon, then lambda, then eta

1274
00:49:44,960 --> 00:49:47,599
then mu, then alpha, so, these characters

1275
00:49:47,599 --> 00:49:50,000
in greek, the theta represents the t-h

1276
00:49:50,000 --> 00:49:50,960
sound

1277
00:49:50,960 --> 00:49:52,480
"th", okay

1278
00:49:52,480 --> 00:49:54,720
then you have the epsilon which is the

1279
00:49:54,720 --> 00:49:57,040
short "e" sound

1280
00:49:57,040 --> 00:50:00,800
"e", then lambda, which is "l" in greek, then

1281
00:50:00,800 --> 00:50:03,839
eta, that's this character, right here

1282
00:50:03,839 --> 00:50:06,000
that i'm pointing that i'm underlining

1283
00:50:06,000 --> 00:50:08,480
with my cursor

1284
00:50:08,480 --> 00:50:10,640
sorry, right there, next to... the this is

1285
00:50:10,640 --> 00:50:12,720
the lambda, and then this is the eta

1286
00:50:12,720 --> 00:50:14,559
right here

1287
00:50:14,559 --> 00:50:18,079
it looks like  an elongated "n"

1288
00:50:18,079 --> 00:50:19,119
okay

1289
00:50:19,119 --> 00:50:20,079
or

1290
00:50:20,079 --> 00:50:22,720
an "h" kind of, without the top

1291
00:50:22,720 --> 00:50:24,640
piece of the "h"

1292
00:50:24,640 --> 00:50:27,599
it would be transliterated into english

1293
00:50:27,599 --> 00:50:29,680
as an h

1294
00:50:29,680 --> 00:50:32,400
and then, next to that, there's mu

1295
00:50:32,400 --> 00:50:34,240
which is an "m"

1296
00:50:34,240 --> 00:50:37,359
and then alpha, which is "a", so, read

1297
00:50:37,359 --> 00:50:40,640
together it's thelema

1298
00:50:40,640 --> 00:50:44,960
t-h-e-l-long ei-m-a

1299
00:50:44,960 --> 00:50:47,920
okay, thelema

1300
00:50:47,920 --> 00:50:50,559
thelema is an occult philosophy

1301
00:50:50,559 --> 00:50:52,480
founded by aleister crowley in the early

1302
00:50:52,480 --> 00:50:55,520
nineteen hundreds, one of the main tenets

1303
00:50:55,520 --> 00:50:58,160
of thelema

1304
00:50:58,720 --> 00:51:00,880
i have another error here

1305
00:51:00,880 --> 00:51:04,400
i need the word "is" in there

1306
00:51:07,760 --> 00:51:09,440
one of the main tenets of thelema is

1307
00:51:09,440 --> 00:51:12,160
the development of one's true will, we're

1308
00:51:12,160 --> 00:51:14,640
going to be talking about the concept

1309
00:51:14,640 --> 00:51:16,720
throughout the day, throughout this

1310
00:51:16,720 --> 00:51:19,839
presentation of the true will - what is

1311
00:51:19,839 --> 00:51:21,920
the true will - because will is what

1312
00:51:21,920 --> 00:51:24,480
thelema means, "thelema", actually, is the

1313
00:51:24,480 --> 00:51:26,400
greek word for "will"

1314
00:51:26,400 --> 00:51:29,520
and i probably should write that in here

1315
00:51:29,520 --> 00:51:31,040
let's...

1316
00:51:31,040 --> 00:51:32,800
let me jump back and

1317
00:51:32,800 --> 00:51:37,000
i'll write that right into this

1318
00:51:53,599 --> 00:51:55,760
let me see a little bit of what we'll be

1319
00:51:55,760 --> 00:51:57,280
teaching, and how to become the true

1320
00:51:57,280 --> 00:51:59,040
media, which is

1321
00:51:59,040 --> 00:52:00,880
modifying

1322
00:52:00,880 --> 00:52:04,599
slides in a slideshow

1323
00:52:10,240 --> 00:52:11,839
it's what i do every week and

1324
00:52:11,839 --> 00:52:13,920
occasionally i make mistakes

1325
00:52:13,920 --> 00:52:17,559
so, there it's fixed

1326
00:52:19,440 --> 00:52:21,839
okay

1327
00:52:21,839 --> 00:52:23,119
so, i think that reads a little bit

1328
00:52:23,119 --> 00:52:25,599
better thelema, the greek word for will

1329
00:52:25,599 --> 00:52:27,680
is an occult philosophy

1330
00:52:27,680 --> 00:52:31,880
let's even put that in...

1331
00:52:33,119 --> 00:52:35,760
inside...

1332
00:52:45,440 --> 00:52:48,079
there we go...

1333
00:52:53,839 --> 00:52:57,280
i think that reads even better

1334
00:52:57,359 --> 00:52:59,440
thelema, and then i'm writing in greek

1335
00:52:59,440 --> 00:53:01,839
greek for will - is an occult philosophy

1336
00:53:01,839 --> 00:53:03,359
founded by aleister crowley in the early

1337
00:53:03,359 --> 00:53:05,599
1900s, one of the main tenets

1338
00:53:05,599 --> 00:53:08,400
is the development of one's true will

1339
00:53:08,400 --> 00:53:10,559
the life path of a being

1340
00:53:10,559 --> 00:53:13,280
who has raised their consciousness into

1341
00:53:13,280 --> 00:53:15,760
alignment with universal spiritual law

1342
00:53:15,760 --> 00:53:18,319
that is the true will

1343
00:53:18,319 --> 00:53:20,079
regardless of what anybody else is going

1344
00:53:20,079 --> 00:53:23,599
to attempt to tell you about what

1345
00:53:23,599 --> 00:53:25,680
something like

1346
00:53:25,680 --> 00:53:27,520
"do what thou wilt shall be the whole of

1347
00:53:27,520 --> 00:53:29,839
the law" means, which we will talk about

1348
00:53:29,839 --> 00:53:31,680
that information

1349
00:53:31,680 --> 00:53:34,400
we will talk about that phrase

1350
00:53:34,400 --> 00:53:35,359
okay

1351
00:53:35,359 --> 00:53:37,040
and we're going to talk about what is

1352
00:53:37,040 --> 00:53:39,119
the true will, what does that phrase mean

1353
00:53:39,119 --> 00:53:41,599
what does true will mean in thelemic

1354
00:53:41,599 --> 00:53:43,839
philosophy

1355
00:53:44,240 --> 00:53:46,640
it means that you're on the spiritual

1356
00:53:46,640 --> 00:53:48,720
path, that you are truly meant to be on

1357
00:53:48,720 --> 00:53:52,240
that is your purpose in life

1358
00:53:54,240 --> 00:53:56,640
and people always leave off the second

1359
00:53:56,640 --> 00:53:59,280
part of

1360
00:53:59,440 --> 00:54:01,040
do what thou wilt shall be the whole of

1361
00:54:01,040 --> 00:54:03,280
the law

1362
00:54:03,280 --> 00:54:05,599
they never put the second half of that

1363
00:54:05,599 --> 00:54:08,240
phrase which is "love is the law, love

1364
00:54:08,240 --> 00:54:09,760
under will" - we're going to be breaking

1365
00:54:09,760 --> 00:54:13,040
all of those aspects of that

1366
00:54:13,040 --> 00:54:16,559
main tenet of thelema down

1367
00:54:16,559 --> 00:54:18,240
we are going to be

1368
00:54:18,240 --> 00:54:20,160
talking about what is "do what thou

1369
00:54:20,160 --> 00:54:21,280
wilt" mean

1370
00:54:21,280 --> 00:54:22,480
what is

1371
00:54:22,480 --> 00:54:24,240
"shall be the whole of the law", what does

1372
00:54:24,240 --> 00:54:27,760
"love is the law" mean, what is that

1373
00:54:27,760 --> 00:54:29,440
phrase mean

1374
00:54:29,440 --> 00:54:33,200
what is "love under will" mean

1375
00:54:33,760 --> 00:54:35,920
see, without understanding what the

1376
00:54:35,920 --> 00:54:38,559
individual components of some of this

1377
00:54:38,559 --> 00:54:41,760
philosophy are, what they are all about

1378
00:54:41,760 --> 00:54:42,960
you're not going to understand the

1379
00:54:42,960 --> 00:54:44,559
totality of the philosophy, you have to

1380
00:54:44,559 --> 00:54:47,040
put it all together

1381
00:54:47,040 --> 00:54:49,760
but this is the over... in an overarching

1382
00:54:49,760 --> 00:54:54,000
sense this is what thelema actually is

1383
00:54:54,400 --> 00:54:57,280
it is a occult philosophy

1384
00:54:57,280 --> 00:54:59,760
and it is ultimately about the alignment

1385
00:54:59,760 --> 00:55:02,000
of one's

1386
00:55:02,000 --> 00:55:03,839
life path

1387
00:55:03,839 --> 00:55:04,880
to

1388
00:55:04,880 --> 00:55:07,119
the will of creation

1389
00:55:07,119 --> 00:55:08,480
which is

1390
00:55:08,480 --> 00:55:10,880
natural law

1391
00:55:10,880 --> 00:55:12,720
as just about every other occult

1392
00:55:12,720 --> 00:55:15,040
philosophy, that's what thelema is

1393
00:55:15,040 --> 00:55:17,920
ultimately about

1394
00:55:18,079 --> 00:55:21,480
so, let's continue

1395
00:55:21,760 --> 00:55:23,359
again, that's what i'm explaining here in

1396
00:55:23,359 --> 00:55:24,799
this next

1397
00:55:24,799 --> 00:55:26,880
part of this slide

1398
00:55:26,880 --> 00:55:29,280
like most other occult traditions the

1399
00:55:29,280 --> 00:55:32,960
grand purpose of the thelemic philosophy

1400
00:55:32,960 --> 00:55:35,359
is to guide its adherence to a deep

1401
00:55:35,359 --> 00:55:37,760
understanding of natural law

1402
00:55:37,760 --> 00:55:40,400
and align their behaviors to the will of

1403
00:55:40,400 --> 00:55:42,000
creation

1404
00:55:42,000 --> 00:55:44,079
which would have a great impact in

1405
00:55:44,079 --> 00:55:46,640
maximizing human freedom if people were

1406
00:55:46,640 --> 00:55:47,760
to do that

1407
00:55:47,760 --> 00:55:49,359
if they were to learn

1408
00:55:49,359 --> 00:55:52,079
any one of these occult traditions

1409
00:55:52,079 --> 00:55:54,079
as we talked about

1410
00:55:54,079 --> 00:55:57,680
what is kabbalah's true purpose ?

1411
00:55:57,680 --> 00:56:00,000
kabbalah's purpose is about

1412
00:56:00,000 --> 00:56:01,119
helping

1413
00:56:01,119 --> 00:56:04,240
humanity to align their behavior with

1414
00:56:04,240 --> 00:56:06,240
the will of creation, with the will of

1415
00:56:06,240 --> 00:56:08,240
the divine

1416
00:56:08,240 --> 00:56:10,160
it's about the understanding of the

1417
00:56:10,160 --> 00:56:13,280
interrelationship between man and

1418
00:56:13,280 --> 00:56:15,599
creation

1419
00:56:15,599 --> 00:56:17,520
it's about understanding all the inward

1420
00:56:17,520 --> 00:56:19,760
qualities of the self, and how they work

1421
00:56:19,760 --> 00:56:21,839
in conjunction with

1422
00:56:21,839 --> 00:56:24,400
karma with universal law, to bring about

1423
00:56:24,400 --> 00:56:27,280
the external experiences that we then

1424
00:56:27,280 --> 00:56:31,799
must live with in life

1425
00:56:32,000 --> 00:56:33,839
freemasonry is the same thing, through

1426
00:56:33,839 --> 00:56:35,440
its symbols and its allegories it

1427
00:56:35,440 --> 00:56:38,480
teaches us how to

1428
00:56:38,880 --> 00:56:42,160
align our behavior with universal law

1429
00:56:42,160 --> 00:56:43,599
with the laws of the creator of the

1430
00:56:43,599 --> 00:56:45,760
universe or as it refers to it as the

1431
00:56:45,760 --> 00:56:48,480
grand architect of the universe

1432
00:56:48,480 --> 00:56:52,480
thelema is no different in that regard

1433
00:56:53,119 --> 00:56:55,839
the tarot, that's all it teaches in its

1434
00:56:55,839 --> 00:56:58,799
pictorial symbols, the forces of the

1435
00:56:58,799 --> 00:57:00,640
universe, the forces that are indwelling

1436
00:57:00,640 --> 00:57:02,720
in the individual, and how they totally

1437
00:57:02,720 --> 00:57:04,880
interrelate to each other

1438
00:57:04,880 --> 00:57:08,000
as a system of correspondences through

1439
00:57:08,000 --> 00:57:11,640
pictorial images

1440
00:57:12,280 --> 00:57:14,240
rosicrucianism

1441
00:57:14,240 --> 00:57:17,760
teaches the law of one, it teaches

1442
00:57:17,760 --> 00:57:20,640
universal love

1443
00:57:20,640 --> 00:57:23,200
it teaches heart based intelligence

1444
00:57:23,200 --> 00:57:25,520
that's what the rose on the cross is

1445
00:57:25,520 --> 00:57:26,960
all about

1446
00:57:26,960 --> 00:57:29,119
the heart - that's what the five-petaled

1447
00:57:29,119 --> 00:57:30,799
flower is ultimately about at the heart

1448
00:57:30,799 --> 00:57:33,680
of the unicursal hexagram of thelema

1449
00:57:33,680 --> 00:57:36,799
heart-based intelligence

1450
00:57:36,799 --> 00:57:39,440
you know, the heart combined within

1451
00:57:39,440 --> 00:57:42,160
the power of the mind and the action of

1452
00:57:42,160 --> 00:57:43,839
the body

1453
00:57:43,839 --> 00:57:47,440
so, you have body-mind-spirit

1454
00:57:49,440 --> 00:57:50,720
the trinity

1455
00:57:50,720 --> 00:57:53,720
united

1456
00:57:54,960 --> 00:57:56,720
so, let's continue and talk about what

1457
00:57:56,720 --> 00:58:00,160
the true will actually is

1458
00:58:00,160 --> 00:58:02,240
because when people hear the phrase "do

1459
00:58:02,240 --> 00:58:03,599
what thou wilt"

1460
00:58:03,599 --> 00:58:05,520
they immediately believe that that means

1461
00:58:05,520 --> 00:58:07,119
do whatever you want, and as we're going

1462
00:58:07,119 --> 00:58:10,640
to talk about in the next slide

1463
00:58:10,640 --> 00:58:12,559
that's the exact opposite of what the

1464
00:58:12,559 --> 00:58:14,559
phrase "do what thou wilt" in the thelemic

1465
00:58:14,559 --> 00:58:17,440
tradition means

1466
00:58:17,839 --> 00:58:21,119
and, once again, you...

1467
00:58:21,119 --> 00:58:24,480
you have to acquire this understanding

1468
00:58:24,480 --> 00:58:27,040
by reading all of the material in the

1469
00:58:27,040 --> 00:58:29,119
tradition

1470
00:58:29,119 --> 00:58:30,720
you don't

1471
00:58:30,720 --> 00:58:33,520
just immediately pick up the first thing

1472
00:58:33,520 --> 00:58:36,000
read it, understand it immediately, and it

1473
00:58:36,000 --> 00:58:37,200
tells you everything you need to know

1474
00:58:37,200 --> 00:58:39,520
if you're expecting that

1475
00:58:39,520 --> 00:58:41,359
don't even bother with thelema, don't

1476
00:58:41,359 --> 00:58:42,799
even bother looking into it, you're going

1477
00:58:42,799 --> 00:58:44,480
to be sorely disappointed, that's not

1478
00:58:44,480 --> 00:58:47,200
what it's for

1479
00:58:47,599 --> 00:58:50,480
it's for

1480
00:58:50,480 --> 00:58:53,599
delving into something so deeply and not

1481
00:58:53,599 --> 00:58:56,079
initially being able to grasp it, that

1482
00:58:56,079 --> 00:58:59,520
you turn your mind over to it until you

1483
00:58:59,520 --> 00:59:01,920
gain a deep foundational understanding

1484
00:59:01,920 --> 00:59:02,839
of it

1485
00:59:04,000 --> 00:59:06,720
it's when you read encoded material

1486
00:59:06,720 --> 00:59:09,119
it's forcing you to think

1487
00:59:09,119 --> 00:59:10,160
at

1488
00:59:10,160 --> 00:59:12,720
a higher level, it's forcing you to think

1489
00:59:12,720 --> 00:59:15,599
at that correlative level

1490
00:59:15,599 --> 00:59:17,760
and that's deliberate, crowley was doing

1491
00:59:17,760 --> 00:59:20,079
that deliberately

1492
00:59:20,079 --> 00:59:22,160
and then he claims he did some automatic

1493
00:59:22,160 --> 00:59:24,240
channel writing, of course

1494
00:59:24,240 --> 00:59:26,400
so, who knows, the consciousnesses that

1495
00:59:26,400 --> 00:59:28,079
were giving him some of that information

1496
00:59:28,079 --> 00:59:30,160
if you believe that, may have been doing

1497
00:59:30,160 --> 00:59:31,920
that deliberately, they're encoding it

1498
00:59:31,920 --> 00:59:34,559
deliberately

1499
00:59:36,400 --> 00:59:38,640
i have some homemade watermelon juice

1500
00:59:38,640 --> 00:59:40,079
today, if you've never

1501
00:59:40,079 --> 00:59:43,839
folks, just as a complete aside obviously

1502
00:59:43,839 --> 00:59:45,599
nutritionally, it's one of the most

1503
00:59:45,599 --> 00:59:47,280
hydrating things you could drink, if

1504
00:59:47,280 --> 00:59:49,440
you've never juiced watermelon you have

1505
00:59:49,440 --> 00:59:51,680
to do it, you just must

1506
00:59:51,680 --> 00:59:54,160
and, i mean, get a fresh watermelon

1507
00:59:54,160 --> 00:59:55,520
juice the whole thing through a

1508
00:59:55,520 --> 00:59:59,119
centrifugal juicer, with the rind, with

1509
00:59:59,119 --> 01:00:01,440
the skin and rind, this is technically a

1510
01:00:01,440 --> 01:00:04,400
green juice, believe it or not, the bulk

1511
01:00:04,400 --> 01:00:07,599
of what's in there is the the green rind

1512
01:00:07,599 --> 01:00:09,440
and it's you could consider this a green

1513
01:00:09,440 --> 01:00:11,200
juice even though it's like red and

1514
01:00:11,200 --> 01:00:12,559
reddish in color

1515
01:00:12,559 --> 01:00:15,760
but, the the balance between the rind and

1516
01:00:15,760 --> 01:00:17,200
the flesh

1517
01:00:17,200 --> 01:00:19,440
makes the glycemic index go down and

1518
01:00:19,440 --> 01:00:23,040
it's ultra-ultra hydrating

1519
01:00:24,960 --> 01:00:26,000
see

1520
01:00:26,000 --> 01:00:28,799
the thelema tradition would include

1521
01:00:28,799 --> 01:00:31,280
proper nutrition, as well, would include

1522
01:00:31,280 --> 01:00:33,040
taking care of the physical vessel, the

1523
01:00:33,040 --> 01:00:34,640
alchemical

1524
01:00:35,760 --> 01:00:39,280
aspects and treatments that you could do

1525
01:00:39,280 --> 01:00:41,280
to keep the body

1526
01:00:41,280 --> 01:00:43,520
optimal

1527
01:00:43,520 --> 01:00:45,359
let's go back to

1528
01:00:45,359 --> 01:00:49,040
what the true will really is

1529
01:00:49,200 --> 01:00:51,760
the true will is the opposite of your

1530
01:00:51,760 --> 01:00:54,880
base desires of what you want

1531
01:00:54,880 --> 01:00:57,359
what i want to do

1532
01:00:57,359 --> 01:01:00,480
what... the comforts that i want

1533
01:01:00,480 --> 01:01:02,720
the pleasures that i want, that's has

1534
01:01:02,720 --> 01:01:05,440
nothing to do with the true will

1535
01:01:05,440 --> 01:01:06,960
the true will

1536
01:01:06,960 --> 01:01:09,599
is deferring those things

1537
01:01:09,599 --> 01:01:10,799
and or

1538
01:01:10,799 --> 01:01:13,280
keeping them at bay at least to the

1539
01:01:13,280 --> 01:01:15,599
extent that you can really focus on the

1540
01:01:15,599 --> 01:01:17,040
higher will

1541
01:01:17,040 --> 01:01:19,760
the true will

1542
01:01:20,720 --> 01:01:23,520
true will or thelema

1543
01:01:23,520 --> 01:01:26,240
is defined in the thelemic philosophy as

1544
01:01:26,240 --> 01:01:29,599
a path of personal action

1545
01:01:29,599 --> 01:01:32,240
that operates in harmony with universal

1546
01:01:32,240 --> 01:01:34,319
spiritual law, i want to read that

1547
01:01:34,319 --> 01:01:37,119
sentence one more time, because

1548
01:01:37,119 --> 01:01:39,599
i really want people to understand this

1549
01:01:39,599 --> 01:01:43,520
and emphasize what is being said

1550
01:01:43,520 --> 01:01:44,640
it's a

1551
01:01:44,640 --> 01:01:49,040
the true will is a path of personal

1552
01:01:49,040 --> 01:01:50,799
action

1553
01:01:50,799 --> 01:01:53,359
it's not your thoughts, it's not your

1554
01:01:53,359 --> 01:01:56,319
emotions, it's not your desires, it's not

1555
01:01:56,319 --> 01:01:58,799
your wants, it's not what you think

1556
01:01:58,799 --> 01:02:01,280
should happen

1557
01:02:01,280 --> 01:02:02,480
it's not

1558
01:02:02,480 --> 01:02:05,520
coming into total emotional

1559
01:02:05,520 --> 01:02:06,799
well-being

1560
01:02:06,799 --> 01:02:09,599
it's not bliss

1561
01:02:09,599 --> 01:02:12,960
it's none of those things

1562
01:02:13,599 --> 01:02:16,400
it is action

1563
01:02:16,400 --> 01:02:18,960
that's the key word in there

1564
01:02:18,960 --> 01:02:22,880
true will is a path of personal action

1565
01:02:22,880 --> 01:02:24,799
it's what you

1566
01:02:24,799 --> 01:02:26,480
do

1567
01:02:26,480 --> 01:02:30,000
once again, wisdom

1568
01:02:30,240 --> 01:02:31,920
is

1569
01:02:31,920 --> 01:02:34,319
the top of the trivium, right, you have

1570
01:02:34,319 --> 01:02:37,920
knowledge, understanding, wisdom

1571
01:02:37,920 --> 01:02:39,359
on the

1572
01:02:39,359 --> 01:02:42,240
very top of the kabbalistic tree of life

1573
01:02:42,240 --> 01:02:44,799
before you get to the crown

1574
01:02:44,799 --> 01:02:46,839
right

1575
01:02:46,839 --> 01:02:48,799
kether

1576
01:02:48,799 --> 01:02:52,559
when you're so-called crossing the abyss

1577
01:02:52,559 --> 01:02:54,720
going into that higher

1578
01:02:54,720 --> 01:02:56,880
triangle, at the very top of the tree of

1579
01:02:56,880 --> 01:02:57,920
life

1580
01:02:57,920 --> 01:03:00,480
if you look at the sefirothic tree

1581
01:03:00,480 --> 01:03:03,839
of life in kabbalah

1582
01:03:05,760 --> 01:03:08,640
before you get to that top triangle

1583
01:03:08,640 --> 01:03:10,079
what is the

1584
01:03:10,079 --> 01:03:11,119
sphere

1585
01:03:11,119 --> 01:03:12,880
that is there, it is not one of the

1586
01:03:12,880 --> 01:03:15,119
seferoth, but it is considered where the

1587
01:03:15,119 --> 01:03:18,440
tree grows from, it is daath

1588
01:03:18,440 --> 01:03:20,240
d-a-a-t-h

1589
01:03:20,240 --> 01:03:22,079
what is that ? knowledge

1590
01:03:22,079 --> 01:03:24,720
that's the first step of the trivium

1591
01:03:24,720 --> 01:03:26,880
then you go up to

1592
01:03:26,880 --> 01:03:28,000
binah

1593
01:03:28,000 --> 01:03:30,720
bina is understanding, that's the second

1594
01:03:30,720 --> 01:03:32,400
step of the trivium

1595
01:03:32,400 --> 01:03:35,359
then you go over to hokma

1596
01:03:35,359 --> 01:03:37,599
which is the one right before the crown

1597
01:03:37,599 --> 01:03:39,520
that sits at the right hand side of the

1598
01:03:39,520 --> 01:03:40,799
crown

1599
01:03:40,799 --> 01:03:45,839
kether, hokhmah means wisdom

1600
01:03:45,839 --> 01:03:46,960
daath

1601
01:03:46,960 --> 01:03:50,319
is not even physical, it's the

1602
01:03:50,319 --> 01:03:53,359
hidden realm of knowledge

1603
01:03:53,359 --> 01:03:56,000
that is the occult itself, that's the

1604
01:03:56,000 --> 01:03:58,720
pure information and potentiality, and

1605
01:03:58,720 --> 01:04:00,720
that's where the physical bursts forth

1606
01:04:00,720 --> 01:04:03,920
from, that's the root of the tree

1607
01:04:03,920 --> 01:04:06,640
and then, the two top parts of the

1608
01:04:06,640 --> 01:04:09,359
two pillars on the tree of life

1609
01:04:09,359 --> 01:04:11,440
binah and hokhmah

1610
01:04:11,440 --> 01:04:13,760
understanding and wisdom, understanding

1611
01:04:13,760 --> 01:04:15,839
is an internal process, that's the second

1612
01:04:15,839 --> 01:04:18,000
phase of the trivium, once you have the

1613
01:04:18,000 --> 01:04:20,240
knowledge you have to make strides to

1614
01:04:20,240 --> 01:04:22,480
understand it, weed out all

1615
01:04:22,480 --> 01:04:24,559
contradiction, weed out logical

1616
01:04:24,559 --> 01:04:27,119
inconsistencies and contradictions, come

1617
01:04:27,119 --> 01:04:29,440
to an understanding of what all that

1618
01:04:29,440 --> 01:04:32,240
aggregated knowledge means

1619
01:04:32,240 --> 01:04:34,480
then what are you going to do with it

1620
01:04:34,480 --> 01:04:36,559
just having it and understanding it

1621
01:04:36,559 --> 01:04:38,960
doesn't make you good

1622
01:04:38,960 --> 01:04:40,720
just having it and understanding it - is

1623
01:04:40,720 --> 01:04:42,160
going to accomplish nothing, unless you

1624
01:04:42,160 --> 01:04:44,799
do the right things with it

1625
01:04:44,799 --> 01:04:46,799
well, when you act rightly upon that

1626
01:04:46,799 --> 01:04:48,559
knowledge and understanding - that's

1627
01:04:48,559 --> 01:04:51,039
wisdom

1628
01:04:52,079 --> 01:04:54,559
so, wisdom is right action

1629
01:04:54,559 --> 01:04:55,839
see

1630
01:04:55,839 --> 01:04:59,039
so, true will can be considered wisdom

1631
01:04:59,039 --> 01:05:01,280
it's a path of personal right action

1632
01:05:01,280 --> 01:05:03,280
because it's action that operates in

1633
01:05:03,280 --> 01:05:05,680
harmony with universal spiritual law, or

1634
01:05:05,680 --> 01:05:08,319
in other words, natural law, when you've

1635
01:05:08,319 --> 01:05:10,319
aligned your life path

1636
01:05:10,319 --> 01:05:13,440
your actions of your life - with natural

1637
01:05:13,440 --> 01:05:15,920
law, and that doesn't just mean

1638
01:05:15,920 --> 01:05:17,839
in the negative, in the apathetic not

1639
01:05:17,839 --> 01:05:20,319
doing harm, it means teaching natural law

1640
01:05:20,319 --> 01:05:22,480
it means you're communicating what is

1641
01:05:22,480 --> 01:05:23,680
right to other people, you're

1642
01:05:23,680 --> 01:05:26,000
communicating objective morality, you're

1643
01:05:26,000 --> 01:05:27,920
living in harmony with natural law

1644
01:05:27,920 --> 01:05:29,680
because you become a servant of natural

1645
01:05:29,680 --> 01:05:31,200
law

1646
01:05:31,200 --> 01:05:32,960
ultimately that's what

1647
01:05:32,960 --> 01:05:36,160
creation's will is for its children

1648
01:05:36,160 --> 01:05:37,920
whether anybody really wants to accept

1649
01:05:37,920 --> 01:05:39,920
the truth of the matter or not, that is

1650
01:05:39,920 --> 01:05:42,000
what we are here to learn to do

1651
01:05:42,000 --> 01:05:44,079
we are all here to learn

1652
01:05:44,079 --> 01:05:45,039
to

1653
01:05:45,039 --> 01:05:47,680
listen to the voice of

1654
01:05:47,680 --> 01:05:48,799
wisdom

1655
01:05:48,799 --> 01:05:51,520
we are here to then become the voice of

1656
01:05:51,520 --> 01:05:53,520
wisdom because the creator of the

1657
01:05:53,520 --> 01:05:56,160
universe doesn't have a physical voice

1658
01:05:56,160 --> 01:05:57,680
in the 3d world

1659
01:05:57,680 --> 01:06:01,440
we are to be that voice, we are to put

1660
01:06:01,440 --> 01:06:04,960
the law of creation into effect through

1661
01:06:04,960 --> 01:06:06,799
our voice

1662
01:06:06,799 --> 01:06:08,400
help to express

1663
01:06:08,400 --> 01:06:10,400
its understanding through our voice, is a

1664
01:06:10,400 --> 01:06:12,559
better way of saying it, so, the people

1665
01:06:12,559 --> 01:06:14,240
can then get it and then live their

1666
01:06:14,240 --> 01:06:16,559
lives in alignment with it, align their

1667
01:06:16,559 --> 01:06:18,480
behavior to it

1668
01:06:18,480 --> 01:06:20,559
and this is what thelema helps us to

1669
01:06:20,559 --> 01:06:23,200
understand, because it's practices, which

1670
01:06:23,200 --> 01:06:25,440
are often meditative practices, yogic

1671
01:06:25,440 --> 01:06:28,319
practices, practices of, really again

1672
01:06:28,319 --> 01:06:30,720
looking at symbol and allegory

1673
01:06:30,720 --> 01:06:33,039
and coming into a level of correlative

1674
01:06:33,039 --> 01:06:34,880
thinking, so, that we understand natural

1675
01:06:34,880 --> 01:06:38,240
law at a deep fundamental level

1676
01:06:38,240 --> 01:06:40,160
and then we're aligning our behavior

1677
01:06:40,160 --> 01:06:42,559
with it

1678
01:06:43,039 --> 01:06:44,319
so

1679
01:06:44,319 --> 01:06:46,720
a path of personal action that operates

1680
01:06:46,720 --> 01:06:50,000
in harmony with natural law

1681
01:06:50,000 --> 01:06:54,000
distinct and separate from the base will

1682
01:06:54,000 --> 01:06:56,640
lower case "w", you notice, everywhere i'm

1683
01:06:56,640 --> 01:06:58,480
going to write the word true will - it's

1684
01:06:58,480 --> 01:07:02,079
an uppercase "w"

1685
01:07:02,400 --> 01:07:07,839
when you see me write will lowercase "w" - that's

1686
01:07:07,839 --> 01:07:10,160
i want

1687
01:07:10,160 --> 01:07:12,720
that's the ego

1688
01:07:12,720 --> 01:07:15,839
that's the personality

1689
01:07:15,839 --> 01:07:17,440
okay

1690
01:07:17,440 --> 01:07:19,440
that's the role that one is playing in

1691
01:07:19,440 --> 01:07:21,920
the world

1692
01:07:22,160 --> 01:07:26,160
higher case "w", capital "w", uppercase "w"

1693
01:07:26,160 --> 01:07:29,039
is the true will of thelema

1694
01:07:29,039 --> 01:07:34,400
lowercase "w" is what do i want for me

1695
01:07:35,280 --> 01:07:36,960
my desires

1696
01:07:36,960 --> 01:07:39,839
my comfort

1697
01:07:40,720 --> 01:07:42,720
what i want to do

1698
01:07:42,720 --> 01:07:44,880
as opposed to what i know i need to be

1699
01:07:44,880 --> 01:07:49,280
doing, should be doing, must do

1700
01:07:49,440 --> 01:07:51,760
totally different

1701
01:07:51,760 --> 01:07:54,319
distinct and separate from lower base

1702
01:07:54,319 --> 01:07:57,039
desires

1703
01:07:57,039 --> 01:07:59,760
true will manifest from the interplay

1704
01:07:59,760 --> 01:08:01,359
between the higher self and the whole

1705
01:08:01,359 --> 01:08:03,440
universe

1706
01:08:03,440 --> 01:08:04,880
once again

1707
01:08:04,880 --> 01:08:07,119
that's what

1708
01:08:07,119 --> 01:08:09,440
the kabbalistic tradition and the tarot

1709
01:08:09,440 --> 01:08:11,359
tradition show us when we study them in

1710
01:08:11,359 --> 01:08:14,240
conjunction with each other, when we lay

1711
01:08:14,240 --> 01:08:17,600
the tarot cards out on the two trees, the

1712
01:08:17,600 --> 01:08:19,759
two kabbalistic trees - the microcosmic

1713
01:08:19,759 --> 01:08:22,799
tree and the macrocosmic tree, one shows

1714
01:08:22,799 --> 01:08:25,679
us the path to the higher self

1715
01:08:25,679 --> 01:08:27,920
from base desires and being stuck in

1716
01:08:27,920 --> 01:08:31,359
ignorance to self-mastery, the other tree

1717
01:08:31,359 --> 01:08:33,920
shows us the forces of the universe

1718
01:08:33,920 --> 01:08:36,399
from judgment, when we remain in base

1719
01:08:36,399 --> 01:08:38,960
desires and ignorance, to

1720
01:08:38,960 --> 01:08:41,120
natural law, which is justice

1721
01:08:41,120 --> 01:08:45,440
when we have applied self-mastery

1722
01:08:45,920 --> 01:08:48,399
so, that's where true will is born from

1723
01:08:48,399 --> 01:08:50,479
it manifests from

1724
01:08:50,479 --> 01:08:54,000
the understanding and interplay of the

1725
01:08:54,000 --> 01:08:56,719
higher self and all of creation, so, it's

1726
01:08:56,719 --> 01:08:58,799
the understanding of the self and the

1727
01:08:58,799 --> 01:09:00,238
understanding of

1728
01:09:00,238 --> 01:09:02,158
the forces that are at work in the

1729
01:09:02,158 --> 01:09:04,640
cosmos

1730
01:09:04,640 --> 01:09:07,279
both physical and spiritual, and

1731
01:09:07,279 --> 01:09:09,120
behavioral

1732
01:09:09,120 --> 01:09:11,440
laws

1733
01:09:12,080 --> 01:09:15,120
and the true will then once we

1734
01:09:15,120 --> 01:09:17,679
have developed that interplay, and we

1735
01:09:17,679 --> 01:09:19,120
have

1736
01:09:19,120 --> 01:09:22,238
begin to develop the true will

1737
01:09:22,238 --> 01:09:25,520
the true will, that path of action, will

1738
01:09:25,520 --> 01:09:27,120
guide us

1739
01:09:27,120 --> 01:09:28,960
those of us who will follow it, who will

1740
01:09:28,960 --> 01:09:30,479
actually

1741
01:09:30,479 --> 01:09:31,920
do

1742
01:09:31,920 --> 01:09:34,640
that action, meaning they they've come

1743
01:09:34,640 --> 01:09:38,400
into a place of wisdom

1744
01:09:38,479 --> 01:09:41,439
it will put you on

1745
01:09:41,439 --> 01:09:44,799
to your ultimate purpose in life

1746
01:09:44,799 --> 01:09:46,719
it will put you on to

1747
01:09:46,719 --> 01:09:51,279
the purpose that you manifested here for

1748
01:09:51,279 --> 01:09:52,479
and, see

1749
01:09:52,479 --> 01:09:55,120
i could say all day

1750
01:09:55,120 --> 01:09:56,239
yes

1751
01:09:56,239 --> 01:09:58,080
i'm bitter about

1752
01:09:58,080 --> 01:10:00,640
from a from an egoic point of view

1753
01:10:00,640 --> 01:10:02,880
from a personal point of view i'm bitter

1754
01:10:02,880 --> 01:10:04,800
i've done all of this work and the the

1755
01:10:04,800 --> 01:10:07,040
world is still completely enslaved

1756
01:10:07,040 --> 01:10:08,719
let's face it, i got a big chip on my

1757
01:10:08,719 --> 01:10:10,719
shoulder about it, from a personal point

1758
01:10:10,719 --> 01:10:13,120
of view

1759
01:10:13,280 --> 01:10:15,199
and i feel like i have that chip on my

1760
01:10:15,199 --> 01:10:16,800
shoulder, because i've tried been trying

1761
01:10:16,800 --> 01:10:17,920
to explain

1762
01:10:17,920 --> 01:10:19,600
to rock

1763
01:10:19,600 --> 01:10:22,640
hard heads out there

1764
01:10:22,640 --> 01:10:25,199
that you need to take action, it's not

1765
01:10:25,199 --> 01:10:26,800
good enough that you know any bit of

1766
01:10:26,800 --> 01:10:28,960
this, you can know every bit of this, and

1767
01:10:28,960 --> 01:10:31,920
it's useless, unless you yourself are

1768
01:10:31,920 --> 01:10:34,719
taking action based on it, because that's

1769
01:10:34,719 --> 01:10:36,800
the whole and all-encompassing

1770
01:10:36,800 --> 01:10:38,960
all-important word in this entire

1771
01:10:38,960 --> 01:10:40,560
exchange

1772
01:10:40,560 --> 01:10:42,239
if you don't understand that the true

1773
01:10:42,239 --> 01:10:45,440
will is action, it's not about anything

1774
01:10:45,440 --> 01:10:47,679
you want, it's not about what you know

1775
01:10:47,679 --> 01:10:50,000
it's not about what you feel inside, it's

1776
01:10:50,000 --> 01:10:52,960
about what are you

1777
01:10:52,960 --> 01:10:54,000
you

1778
01:10:54,000 --> 01:10:55,280
you

1779
01:10:55,280 --> 01:10:57,360
going to

1780
01:10:57,360 --> 01:10:59,840
do

1781
01:11:00,159 --> 01:11:03,280
what are you going to do

1782
01:11:03,280 --> 01:11:05,360
if you haven't answered that

1783
01:11:05,360 --> 01:11:08,159
question, and then made it happen

1784
01:11:08,159 --> 01:11:09,840
you're not doing the true will, you're

1785
01:11:09,840 --> 01:11:11,920
not on the path of the true will, you

1786
01:11:11,920 --> 01:11:14,000
have no real purpose, you're floating

1787
01:11:14,000 --> 01:11:15,600
through life effortless

1788
01:11:15,600 --> 01:11:18,080
not effortlessly, but you're floating

1789
01:11:18,080 --> 01:11:21,440
through life aimlessly

1790
01:11:21,520 --> 01:11:23,600
you don't have a clear... see, this is what

1791
01:11:23,600 --> 01:11:26,960
thelema helps with, it helps for one, for

1792
01:11:26,960 --> 01:11:29,040
the adherent, for the student

1793
01:11:29,040 --> 01:11:30,480
the practitioner, however you want to

1794
01:11:30,480 --> 01:11:32,000
look at that

1795
01:11:32,000 --> 01:11:33,440
to

1796
01:11:33,440 --> 01:11:36,159
develop a clear picture of what they

1797
01:11:36,159 --> 01:11:38,640
must do

1798
01:11:39,520 --> 01:11:42,000
when you really have a

1799
01:11:42,000 --> 01:11:45,360
firm grasp of the thelemic tradition, by

1800
01:11:45,360 --> 01:11:48,320
reading its documents, by studying it, by

1801
01:11:48,320 --> 01:11:50,880
really pondering what it means

1802
01:11:50,880 --> 01:11:53,440
not just even listening to the words

1803
01:11:53,440 --> 01:11:54,560
okay

1804
01:11:54,560 --> 01:11:58,719
this is a personal relationship

1805
01:11:59,040 --> 01:12:01,199
no one would then start asking the

1806
01:12:01,199 --> 01:12:03,920
question - oh, what can i do ? what should i

1807
01:12:03,920 --> 01:12:06,840
do ? i don't know what to do - that will be

1808
01:12:06,840 --> 01:12:12,000
gone - gone, gone, gone from you

1809
01:12:12,080 --> 01:12:15,440
and this is part of the problem

1810
01:12:15,520 --> 01:12:18,080
i think, because people don't go deeply

1811
01:12:18,080 --> 01:12:20,239
enough into esoteric knowledge and into

1812
01:12:20,239 --> 01:12:22,719
the world of the occult, and they think

1813
01:12:22,719 --> 01:12:24,640
all of this is bad

1814
01:12:24,640 --> 01:12:27,760
because some other fucking moron told

1815
01:12:27,760 --> 01:12:30,159
them - yeah, all the occult is bad, and you

1816
01:12:30,159 --> 01:12:31,920
shouldn't look in any of that

1817
01:12:31,920 --> 01:12:33,679
no, it's actually the most powerful

1818
01:12:33,679 --> 01:12:35,280
information on earth

1819
01:12:35,280 --> 01:12:37,600
in the cosmos, in general, that the

1820
01:12:37,600 --> 01:12:39,440
elitists don't want you to look at, so

1821
01:12:39,440 --> 01:12:41,920
you stay a stupid motherfucker

1822
01:12:41,920 --> 01:12:44,880
that's really how it works

1823
01:12:44,880 --> 01:12:46,880
so, once again

1824
01:12:46,880 --> 01:12:48,480
anybody's free to think of it however

1825
01:12:48,480 --> 01:12:50,719
you want - crowley was a satanist, i'm not

1826
01:12:50,719 --> 01:12:53,120
looking into thelema, fuck that

1827
01:12:53,120 --> 01:12:55,760
stay a dumb motherfucker then, stay

1828
01:12:55,760 --> 01:12:56,800
a purpose...

1829
01:12:56,800 --> 01:12:59,280
stay a purposeless person

1830
01:12:59,280 --> 01:13:02,239
floating through life aimlessly

1831
01:13:02,239 --> 01:13:04,159
and you're not going anywhere else

1832
01:13:04,159 --> 01:13:05,760
you're coming right back here, you're

1833
01:13:05,760 --> 01:13:07,280
gonna do it again, and again, and again

1834
01:13:07,280 --> 01:13:09,120
and again, until your hard head

1835
01:13:09,120 --> 01:13:11,040
fucking breaks like a rock

1836
01:13:11,040 --> 01:13:13,360
until the ego gets busted down into

1837
01:13:13,360 --> 01:13:14,480
powder

1838
01:13:14,480 --> 01:13:16,560
and then broken down even more and

1839
01:13:16,560 --> 01:13:19,040
nothing

1840
01:13:19,040 --> 01:13:20,800
you're coming back here

1841
01:13:20,800 --> 01:13:22,480
forever

1842
01:13:22,480 --> 01:13:24,320
until your hard head

1843
01:13:24,320 --> 01:13:25,360
decides

1844
01:13:25,360 --> 01:13:27,440
that it's the thing that is wrong and

1845
01:13:27,440 --> 01:13:30,159
needs to change

1846
01:13:31,360 --> 01:13:32,880
but you're free to believe whatever the

1847
01:13:32,880 --> 01:13:34,880
fuck you want and make that process as

1848
01:13:34,880 --> 01:13:36,960
painful as you want to make it

1849
01:13:36,960 --> 01:13:40,400
the universe will let you have that

1850
01:13:41,040 --> 01:13:42,880
you're not hurting anybody but yourself

1851
01:13:42,880 --> 01:13:44,320
ultimately, but

1852
01:13:44,320 --> 01:13:46,000
part of the problem is {you kind of are}

1853
01:13:46,000 --> 01:13:47,280
because you're hurting other people that

1854
01:13:47,280 --> 01:13:49,679
actually do want to be free

1855
01:13:49,679 --> 01:13:51,679
with your ignorance

1856
01:13:51,679 --> 01:13:52,800
you know

1857
01:13:52,800 --> 01:13:55,520
willful ignorance does in the long term

1858
01:13:55,520 --> 01:13:58,840
harm others

1859
01:14:01,120 --> 01:14:04,480
so, going back to what i was saying

1860
01:14:04,800 --> 01:14:08,080
after i got thelema deeply

1861
01:14:08,080 --> 01:14:09,760
there's no more thinking what do you

1862
01:14:09,760 --> 01:14:11,360
need to do

1863
01:14:11,360 --> 01:14:14,719
you know what you need to do

1864
01:14:14,719 --> 01:14:17,679
and you start doing it

1865
01:14:17,679 --> 01:14:19,440
you're not asking questions about it

1866
01:14:19,440 --> 01:14:21,280
anymore, you're not dilly-dallying about

1867
01:14:21,280 --> 01:14:23,440
it, you get on it

1868
01:14:23,440 --> 01:14:25,679
you see

1869
01:14:25,679 --> 01:14:27,679
because you understand that you're here

1870
01:14:27,679 --> 01:14:30,239
to take action

1871
01:14:30,239 --> 01:14:33,600
not to go {woe as} me, not to go "what can i

1872
01:14:33,600 --> 01:14:35,360
do"

1873
01:14:35,360 --> 01:14:39,040
oh, i don't know how to do that

1874
01:14:40,400 --> 01:14:43,360
this tradition makes you confront

1875
01:14:43,360 --> 01:14:45,520
all your bullshit excuses, it makes you

1876
01:14:45,520 --> 01:14:48,560
confront your laziness, it tells you the

1877
01:14:48,560 --> 01:14:52,480
only one responsible for ultimately

1878
01:14:52,480 --> 01:14:54,080
either staying where you're at or

1879
01:14:54,080 --> 01:14:57,040
changing it is you, that's it

1880
01:14:57,040 --> 01:14:59,360
you are solely responsible

1881
01:14:59,360 --> 01:15:01,199
other people have influences in many

1882
01:15:01,199 --> 01:15:03,280
areas of life, of course, i'm not going to

1883
01:15:03,280 --> 01:15:04,719
say that they don't

1884
01:15:04,719 --> 01:15:06,159
but ultimately

1885
01:15:06,159 --> 01:15:07,760
if you're not part of the solution

1886
01:15:07,760 --> 01:15:09,760
you're part of the problem, if you're not

1887
01:15:09,760 --> 01:15:11,679
actively involved in taking action to

1888
01:15:11,679 --> 01:15:13,520
change it, you're the one helping anchor

1889
01:15:13,520 --> 01:15:16,159
it and to keep it there

1890
01:15:16,159 --> 01:15:19,120
you have to take action to make

1891
01:15:19,120 --> 01:15:22,159
a huge weight move

1892
01:15:22,159 --> 01:15:24,640
and, yeah, i get bitter, because i look at

1893
01:15:24,640 --> 01:15:27,120
i've been doing this for, you know

1894
01:15:27,120 --> 01:15:29,360
over 15 years

1895
01:15:29,360 --> 01:15:32,960
what has changed - hardly anything

1896
01:15:33,040 --> 01:15:34,480
there's some more people who are

1897
01:15:34,480 --> 01:15:36,960
beginning to grasp and understand the

1898
01:15:36,960 --> 01:15:39,840
great work and  do it themselves, yes

1899
01:15:39,840 --> 01:15:42,000
that's happening slowly

1900
01:15:42,000 --> 01:15:46,239
all too slowly, but it is happening

1901
01:15:48,080 --> 01:15:50,320
but when you get on this

1902
01:15:50,320 --> 01:15:52,880
personal path of action

1903
01:15:52,880 --> 01:15:56,400
it totally defines your purpose in life

1904
01:15:57,520 --> 01:15:59,520
and there's nothing better than living a

1905
01:15:59,520 --> 01:16:02,560
purpose-driven life

1906
01:16:03,280 --> 01:16:05,120
again, i could say i'm bitter, because i'd

1907
01:16:05,120 --> 01:16:08,880
rather, i'd quite rather

1908
01:16:08,880 --> 01:16:12,640
{us} be free and have our lives to live as

1909
01:16:12,640 --> 01:16:14,400
we see fit, which is how it really should

1910
01:16:14,400 --> 01:16:15,920
be, that's the natural state of human

1911
01:16:15,920 --> 01:16:17,520
existence

1912
01:16:17,520 --> 01:16:18,800
anarchy

1913
01:16:18,800 --> 01:16:21,040
and freedom is the natural state of

1914
01:16:21,040 --> 01:16:24,159
human existence, having nobody rule

1915
01:16:24,159 --> 01:16:26,480
but because, unfortunately, there is

1916
01:16:26,480 --> 01:16:28,800
slavery

1917
01:16:28,800 --> 01:16:30,719
those of us who understand the wrongness

1918
01:16:30,719 --> 01:16:33,040
of that dynamic have to teach natural

1919
01:16:33,040 --> 01:16:37,280
law, i'm confined to this path, because of

1920
01:16:37,280 --> 01:16:40,320
other people's ignorance

1921
01:16:41,120 --> 01:16:44,880
i could get on a path of

1922
01:16:46,159 --> 01:16:49,040
wonderful self-expression and

1923
01:16:49,040 --> 01:16:51,040
exploration of other things that i want

1924
01:16:51,040 --> 01:16:52,159
to do

1925
01:16:52,159 --> 01:16:54,000
i've said many times i could have become

1926
01:16:54,000 --> 01:16:56,080
maybe

1927
01:16:56,080 --> 01:16:58,480
a musician, a painter, an inventor, who

1928
01:16:58,480 --> 01:16:59,520
knows

1929
01:16:59,520 --> 01:17:01,040
i think i have all of those things

1930
01:17:01,040 --> 01:17:02,960
inside of me

1931
01:17:02,960 --> 01:17:05,440
but i don't pursue them, because

1932
01:17:05,440 --> 01:17:09,440
i'm here on doing my true will, on my

1933
01:17:09,440 --> 01:17:10,480
personal

1934
01:17:10,480 --> 01:17:13,520
path of action that i know i must do, and

1935
01:17:13,520 --> 01:17:16,080
must be on

1936
01:17:16,080 --> 01:17:19,199
which is a constraint

1937
01:17:19,760 --> 01:17:22,400
and i do that of my free will, even

1938
01:17:22,400 --> 01:17:25,360
though, like i said, the lower aspect of

1939
01:17:25,360 --> 01:17:26,960
me can be bitter about and have a

1940
01:17:26,960 --> 01:17:29,120
fucking big chip on my shoulder about it

1941
01:17:29,120 --> 01:17:31,600
not going to lie

1942
01:17:31,600 --> 01:17:33,920
that's the dichotomy, but it's ultimately

1943
01:17:33,920 --> 01:17:36,640
unified, this is the idea in hermeticism

1944
01:17:36,640 --> 01:17:37,360
that

1945
01:17:37,360 --> 01:17:39,360
you know, opposites can ultimately be

1946
01:17:39,360 --> 01:17:41,199
unified

1947
01:17:41,199 --> 01:17:42,880
i'm still going to do it, i'm still going

1948
01:17:42,880 --> 01:17:44,719
gonna do the true will, because that's

1949
01:17:44,719 --> 01:17:48,320
what i'm charged with to do, it's a bond

1950
01:17:48,320 --> 01:17:51,360
it's a constraint

1951
01:17:52,000 --> 01:17:54,320
all things being equal meaning if we all

1952
01:17:54,320 --> 01:17:57,199
have unrestrained our natural rights

1953
01:17:57,199 --> 01:17:58,880
and they're not under attack

1954
01:17:58,880 --> 01:18:00,880
and they're not being

1955
01:18:00,880 --> 01:18:02,880
occultically

1956
01:18:02,880 --> 01:18:04,800
covertly

1957
01:18:04,800 --> 01:18:07,920
constrained and taken from human beings

1958
01:18:07,920 --> 01:18:12,120
by this occult priest class

1959
01:18:12,880 --> 01:18:15,920
if that were not the case

1960
01:18:15,920 --> 01:18:18,560
i'm not bound to do this, it would be a

1961
01:18:18,560 --> 01:18:21,280
good thing to have this be common sense

1962
01:18:21,280 --> 01:18:23,920
natural law

1963
01:18:23,920 --> 01:18:26,640
but pretty much if... if

1964
01:18:26,640 --> 01:18:28,239
the enslavement of humanity weren't the

1965
01:18:28,239 --> 01:18:29,520
problem, you could pretty much rest

1966
01:18:29,520 --> 01:18:32,320
assured natural law is commonplace in

1967
01:18:32,320 --> 01:18:35,920
that instance, in that scenario

1968
01:18:36,719 --> 01:18:37,840
see, when

1969
01:18:37,840 --> 01:18:39,920
decadence goes into place and corruption

1970
01:18:39,920 --> 01:18:41,199
goes into place

1971
01:18:41,199 --> 01:18:42,320
and evil

1972
01:18:42,320 --> 01:18:45,360
manifests like it has

1973
01:18:45,360 --> 01:18:46,719
that's when

1974
01:18:46,719 --> 01:18:48,560
the true will of

1975
01:18:48,560 --> 01:18:50,640
having to teach natural law

1976
01:18:50,640 --> 01:18:54,640
becomes a constraint, it becomes a bond

1977
01:18:54,640 --> 01:18:57,760
and i'm not saying that's a bad thing

1978
01:18:57,760 --> 01:18:59,600
i'm saying i do it out of my own free

1979
01:18:59,600 --> 01:19:01,360
will, because i know it must be done, it's

1980
01:19:01,360 --> 01:19:04,000
required, it's a requirement

1981
01:19:04,000 --> 01:19:06,159
that makes it a bond, it's like obtaining

1982
01:19:06,159 --> 01:19:07,280
food

1983
01:19:07,280 --> 01:19:09,520
it's a requirement, you're gonna have to

1984
01:19:09,520 --> 01:19:11,840
do it

1985
01:19:11,840 --> 01:19:14,640
so, that's a constraint, it's a boundary

1986
01:19:14,640 --> 01:19:16,640
condition

1987
01:19:16,640 --> 01:19:19,040
that's what law is - it's a boundary

1988
01:19:19,040 --> 01:19:20,320
condition

1989
01:19:20,320 --> 01:19:21,920
it's a set of conditions that are in

1990
01:19:21,920 --> 01:19:24,560
place that have requirements must be

1991
01:19:24,560 --> 01:19:26,880
fulfilled, are always in place, are

1992
01:19:26,880 --> 01:19:30,320
constraining{,} our binding

1993
01:19:33,440 --> 01:19:35,679
but one of the worst things that you

1994
01:19:35,679 --> 01:19:38,719
could ever have really happen is to lead

1995
01:19:38,719 --> 01:19:40,800
a purposeless life

1996
01:19:40,800 --> 01:19:42,960
to lead a life where

1997
01:19:42,960 --> 01:19:44,960
you don't know what your purpose is

1998
01:19:44,960 --> 01:19:46,719
or you don't even care what your purpose

1999
01:19:46,719 --> 01:19:47,679
is

2000
01:19:47,679 --> 01:19:48,560
and

2001
01:19:48,560 --> 01:19:49,840
let me tell you something, folks, there's

2002
01:19:49,840 --> 01:19:52,159
a ton of people in the world living like

2003
01:19:52,159 --> 01:19:54,480
that, a ton

2004
01:19:54,480 --> 01:19:58,000
just living with no purpose

2005
01:19:58,719 --> 01:20:01,520
so while on one hand "yes" i'll say

2006
01:20:01,520 --> 01:20:03,199
i could be bitter and have a chip on my

2007
01:20:03,199 --> 01:20:04,800
shoulder about having to do this work

2008
01:20:04,800 --> 01:20:07,360
non-stop

2009
01:20:08,960 --> 01:20:12,320
it absolutely fulfills purpose

2010
01:20:12,320 --> 01:20:17,120
it has given me a purpose-driven life

2011
01:20:17,120 --> 01:20:18,800
and that's one of the hardest things for

2012
01:20:18,800 --> 01:20:21,840
most people to find

2013
01:20:22,480 --> 01:20:24,719
how do you find what your purpose is to

2014
01:20:24,719 --> 01:20:28,400
do - thelema can help you discover that

2015
01:20:28,400 --> 01:20:30,480
it can help put you on that path, if you

2016
01:20:30,480 --> 01:20:33,840
understand it

2017
01:20:34,719 --> 01:20:37,520
let's continue

2018
01:20:38,880 --> 01:20:42,480
with more on the true will

2019
01:20:43,120 --> 01:20:44,960
those who are in touch with the true

2020
01:20:44,960 --> 01:20:47,600
will have eliminated or bypassed false

2021
01:20:47,600 --> 01:20:50,800
desires and internal contradictions

2022
01:20:50,800 --> 01:20:52,880
and have accessed a deep connection with

2023
01:20:52,880 --> 01:20:55,600
creation itself

2024
01:20:55,600 --> 01:20:58,719
once again, doing the true will

2025
01:20:58,719 --> 01:21:01,920
you could say - some people may

2026
01:21:01,920 --> 01:21:04,960
completely eliminate base desires

2027
01:21:04,960 --> 01:21:07,199
bypassing it or

2028
01:21:07,199 --> 01:21:10,000
keeping a handle on them - is one way of

2029
01:21:10,000 --> 01:21:11,360
saying it

2030
01:21:11,360 --> 01:21:12,960
where

2031
01:21:12,960 --> 01:21:14,639
i will still make the time to put

2032
01:21:14,639 --> 01:21:16,480
together a nice presentation like this, i

2033
01:21:16,480 --> 01:21:19,440
will still make the time to

2034
01:21:19,440 --> 01:21:21,679
have my talking points ready of what i

2035
01:21:21,679 --> 01:21:24,000
want to really discuss with people, make

2036
01:21:24,000 --> 01:21:25,679
the points, that i want to talk about and

2037
01:21:25,679 --> 01:21:27,679
flesh out

2038
01:21:27,679 --> 01:21:30,719
does that mean i can't ever do anything

2039
01:21:30,719 --> 01:21:33,199
of my own

2040
01:21:33,199 --> 01:21:35,120
in other time that i have during the

2041
01:21:35,120 --> 01:21:36,400
week ?

2042
01:21:36,400 --> 01:21:38,480
no, i could still go out and enjoy myself

2043
01:21:38,480 --> 01:21:42,920
go see music, go to a dinner, whatever

2044
01:21:43,600 --> 01:21:46,960
it doesn't mean that you're

2045
01:21:46,960 --> 01:21:50,080
put in a prison and living that

2046
01:21:50,080 --> 01:21:53,440
24-7, non-stop

2047
01:21:53,440 --> 01:21:55,600
but it means - you're making that your

2048
01:21:55,600 --> 01:21:56,800
life

2049
01:21:56,800 --> 01:21:58,480
this is what you're going to take a

2050
01:21:58,480 --> 01:22:01,840
portion of your life to do, to express to

2051
01:22:01,840 --> 01:22:06,320
other people, to teach, to communicate

2052
01:22:06,880 --> 01:22:09,199
most people just will not make it their

2053
01:22:09,199 --> 01:22:11,040
life, they will not make it a part of

2054
01:22:11,040 --> 01:22:13,440
their life, they just think, just...

2055
01:22:13,440 --> 01:22:15,840
i got, i heard it, i heard it, and i

2056
01:22:15,840 --> 01:22:18,480
understand it, and that's good enough

2057
01:22:18,480 --> 01:22:20,000
i'm basically a good person, i'm not

2058
01:22:20,000 --> 01:22:22,080
harming anybody and i understand what's

2059
01:22:22,080 --> 01:22:26,320
going on, it's still not enough

2060
01:22:26,320 --> 01:22:28,800
not reaching out to others means - you're

2061
01:22:28,800 --> 01:22:31,120
allowing the voice of evil to be louder

2062
01:22:31,120 --> 01:22:33,199
than everybody else, to be louder than

2063
01:22:33,199 --> 01:22:34,159
you

2064
01:22:34,159 --> 01:22:36,080
see, if there's evil taking place and

2065
01:22:36,080 --> 01:22:37,600
you're not speaking against it - you're

2066
01:22:37,600 --> 01:22:39,679
not doing the true will

2067
01:22:39,679 --> 01:22:41,360
you're not actively involved in

2068
01:22:41,360 --> 01:22:43,120
developing the true will

2069
01:22:43,120 --> 01:22:45,199
and you haven't conquered

2070
01:22:45,199 --> 01:22:47,280
to the extent that you need to do the

2071
01:22:47,280 --> 01:22:49,760
true will, those

2072
01:22:49,760 --> 01:22:52,480
desires, those contradictions within the

2073
01:22:52,480 --> 01:22:53,840
self

2074
01:22:53,840 --> 01:22:57,120
within the base self

2075
01:22:57,520 --> 01:22:58,400
see

2076
01:22:58,400 --> 01:23:01,840
it doesn't mean that someone

2077
01:23:01,840 --> 01:23:04,000
living the true will

2078
01:23:04,000 --> 01:23:07,199
has no base desires

2079
01:23:07,199 --> 01:23:09,920
it doesn't mean you live in an ascetic

2080
01:23:09,920 --> 01:23:12,960
monk-like lifestyle, okay, that's what you

2081
01:23:12,960 --> 01:23:16,400
have to understand - thelema is not that

2082
01:23:16,400 --> 01:23:19,199
no occult tradition is that, truly

2083
01:23:19,199 --> 01:23:21,199
those ascetic traditions are largely

2084
01:23:21,199 --> 01:23:22,880
eastern and some

2085
01:23:22,880 --> 01:23:25,120
middle eastern traditions, and they're

2086
01:23:25,120 --> 01:23:26,320
not

2087
01:23:26,320 --> 01:23:28,960
healthy, quite frankly

2088
01:23:28,960 --> 01:23:33,840
they're imbalanced, they're imbalanced

2089
01:23:33,840 --> 01:23:36,480
there are positions of extremity that

2090
01:23:36,480 --> 01:23:39,360
don't lead to good places, because you're

2091
01:23:39,360 --> 01:23:41,520
putting

2092
01:23:41,520 --> 01:23:44,480
one aspect of consciousness

2093
01:23:44,480 --> 01:23:46,480
spirituality over

2094
01:23:46,480 --> 01:23:48,719
another aspect of consciousness, which is

2095
01:23:48,719 --> 01:23:50,480
physicality

2096
01:23:50,480 --> 01:23:52,560
physicality and spirituality don't need

2097
01:23:52,560 --> 01:23:54,000
to be

2098
01:23:54,000 --> 01:23:56,400
seen as completely separate and never

2099
01:23:56,400 --> 01:23:59,440
between {shall meet} concepts

2100
01:23:59,440 --> 01:24:01,520
as i teach in my work and as people, who

2101
01:24:01,520 --> 01:24:03,920
really understand real spirituality, have

2102
01:24:03,920 --> 01:24:06,560
taught, they're one and the same

2103
01:24:06,560 --> 01:24:09,120
it's all consciousness

2104
01:24:09,120 --> 01:24:10,800
the body is part of that, the physical

2105
01:24:10,800 --> 01:24:12,639
world is part of that, matter is part of

2106
01:24:12,639 --> 01:24:15,639
that

2107
01:24:16,000 --> 01:24:18,400
so, you don't need to

2108
01:24:18,400 --> 01:24:21,520
forever exterminate desires

2109
01:24:21,520 --> 01:24:23,440
it's not to say, you're not going to have

2110
01:24:23,440 --> 01:24:27,120
base flesh, flesh worldly

2111
01:24:27,120 --> 01:24:29,040
selfish desires, ever

2112
01:24:29,040 --> 01:24:32,320
you're not going to live for them

2113
01:24:32,320 --> 01:24:33,920
to the extent

2114
01:24:33,920 --> 01:24:35,760
that you will not get involved in the

2115
01:24:35,760 --> 01:24:38,239
great work

2116
01:24:38,239 --> 01:24:40,400
you're not going to be controlled by

2117
01:24:40,400 --> 01:24:42,840
them to the extent

2118
01:24:42,840 --> 01:24:45,679
that you're not going to teach natural

2119
01:24:45,679 --> 01:24:47,280
law, that you're not going to speak out

2120
01:24:47,280 --> 01:24:49,360
against evil

2121
01:24:49,360 --> 01:24:52,000
personally

2122
01:24:52,239 --> 01:24:54,159
it's

2123
01:24:54,159 --> 01:24:55,280
you know

2124
01:24:55,280 --> 01:24:57,280
the idea that

2125
01:24:57,280 --> 01:24:58,719
you could fulfill

2126
01:24:58,719 --> 01:25:00,320
based desires

2127
01:25:00,320 --> 01:25:02,159
from time to time

2128
01:25:02,159 --> 01:25:04,400
and

2129
01:25:05,040 --> 01:25:07,840
not be perfect, no one's gonna be perfect

2130
01:25:07,840 --> 01:25:10,960
it's, again, this isn't about leading a

2131
01:25:10,960 --> 01:25:13,760
monk-like ascetic lifestyle for the rest

2132
01:25:13,760 --> 01:25:16,239
of your life, no one's asking that or

2133
01:25:16,239 --> 01:25:18,480
even saying that's a good idea, again, i

2134
01:25:18,480 --> 01:25:19,520
think it's a

2135
01:25:19,520 --> 01:25:21,679
place of extremity, and

2136
01:25:21,679 --> 01:25:24,560
bad extremity, and

2137
01:25:24,560 --> 01:25:27,840
imbalance in consciousness

2138
01:25:30,080 --> 01:25:31,600
but what i'm trying to get at here in

2139
01:25:31,600 --> 01:25:34,000
the true will is that

2140
01:25:34,000 --> 01:25:36,239
you

2141
01:25:36,400 --> 01:25:39,360
keep those things in check

2142
01:25:39,360 --> 01:25:42,159
to the point where you are making

2143
01:25:42,159 --> 01:25:45,679
the doing of the great work

2144
01:25:45,920 --> 01:25:50,159
an absolute part of your existence

2145
01:25:50,239 --> 01:25:52,800
and i personally don't feel that there's

2146
01:25:52,800 --> 01:25:57,199
any excuse for people not to do that

2147
01:25:57,840 --> 01:26:01,600
i think that we live in the type of

2148
01:26:01,600 --> 01:26:05,120
culture and settings largely here in

2149
01:26:05,120 --> 01:26:08,080
what you would call the first world

2150
01:26:08,080 --> 01:26:10,159
western civilization

2151
01:26:10,159 --> 01:26:14,560
who are the people i'm largely speaking to

2152
01:26:14,560 --> 01:26:16,159
we have

2153
01:26:16,159 --> 01:26:18,000
the resources

2154
01:26:18,000 --> 01:26:19,199
we have

2155
01:26:19,199 --> 01:26:23,440
the information, we have the connectivity

2156
01:26:23,440 --> 01:26:25,760
we have the time, even, where we can

2157
01:26:25,760 --> 01:26:28,159
dedicate a certain portion of our life

2158
01:26:28,159 --> 01:26:30,159
to this work

2159
01:26:30,159 --> 01:26:31,360
and that is

2160
01:26:31,360 --> 01:26:33,120
the beginning of the activation of the

2161
01:26:33,120 --> 01:26:36,440
true will

2162
01:26:36,480 --> 01:26:38,159
and then, in the second sentence here i'm

2163
01:26:38,159 --> 01:26:39,840
saying

2164
01:26:39,840 --> 01:26:41,760
as more human beings discover and

2165
01:26:41,760 --> 01:26:43,360
achieve this state of consciousness

2166
01:26:43,360 --> 01:26:45,199
meaning the alignment with the true will

2167
01:26:45,199 --> 01:26:48,719
and and beginning to do that

2168
01:26:48,719 --> 01:26:50,960
accessing that deep connection with

2169
01:26:50,960 --> 01:26:53,280
creation

2170
01:26:53,280 --> 01:26:54,560
the more

2171
01:26:54,560 --> 01:26:56,239
as more human beings discover and

2172
01:26:56,239 --> 01:26:58,320
achieve that state of consciousness

2173
01:26:58,320 --> 01:27:01,280
the more human life will flow without

2174
01:27:01,280 --> 01:27:02,840
resistance in the

2175
01:27:02,840 --> 01:27:04,639
aggregate

2176
01:27:04,639 --> 01:27:06,719
again, this is the law of freedom

2177
01:27:06,719 --> 01:27:08,080
in

2178
01:27:08,080 --> 01:27:09,920
thelemic terms they call this the law

2179
01:27:09,920 --> 01:27:12,560
of liberty

2180
01:27:14,320 --> 01:27:18,040
crowley said that

2181
01:27:18,639 --> 01:27:20,800
the

2182
01:27:20,800 --> 01:27:24,800
liberty of human beings or the...

2183
01:27:24,800 --> 01:27:27,360
he expressed it as - the control

2184
01:27:27,360 --> 01:27:30,840
of the state will be a function of

2185
01:27:30,840 --> 01:27:34,480
the attainment to liberty of each

2186
01:27:34,480 --> 01:27:36,880
human will, i'm paraphrasing, but

2187
01:27:36,880 --> 01:27:38,400
basically, it's like

2188
01:27:38,400 --> 01:27:40,159
as people are

2189
01:27:40,159 --> 01:27:42,320
doing their true will

2190
01:27:42,320 --> 01:27:43,920
more and more

2191
01:27:43,920 --> 01:27:46,080
the state and the controllers will have

2192
01:27:46,080 --> 01:27:47,360
less power

2193
01:27:47,360 --> 01:27:49,679
and more freedom will manifest in the

2194
01:27:49,679 --> 01:27:50,480
world

2195
01:27:50,480 --> 01:27:53,920
it's a function of the individual will

2196
01:27:53,920 --> 01:27:55,520
i'll see, if i could even find the phrase

2197
01:27:55,520 --> 01:27:57,120
give me a moment, because it's worth

2198
01:27:57,120 --> 01:27:59,440
putting up here into the presentation

2199
01:27:59,440 --> 01:28:03,280
i'll actually add it in, during the show

2200
01:28:03,280 --> 01:28:05,360
but this second sentence is what i'm

2201
01:28:05,360 --> 01:28:06,239
saying

2202
01:28:06,239 --> 01:28:09,040
it's what i call the law of freedom

2203
01:28:09,040 --> 01:28:10,960
as more human beings are doing this true

2204
01:28:10,960 --> 01:28:13,040
will, doing the one great work, teaching

2205
01:28:13,040 --> 01:28:15,600
natural law, teaching objective morality

2206
01:28:15,600 --> 01:28:19,520
life will flow with less resistance

2207
01:28:19,520 --> 01:28:21,440
we will actually begin to get what we

2208
01:28:21,440 --> 01:28:24,000
want, when we do the will of creation

2209
01:28:24,000 --> 01:28:26,320
instead of our selfish wills, as we

2210
01:28:26,320 --> 01:28:28,719
become more moral and teach objective

2211
01:28:28,719 --> 01:28:30,000
morality

2212
01:28:30,000 --> 01:28:32,400
and spread objective morality, humanity

2213
01:28:32,400 --> 01:28:34,800
becomes more free, as we refuse to do

2214
01:28:34,800 --> 01:28:36,239
that, and don't care about objective

2215
01:28:36,239 --> 01:28:38,719
morality, and let

2216
01:28:38,719 --> 01:28:41,040
tyrons take over - humanity becomes more

2217
01:28:41,040 --> 01:28:42,639
and more enslaved

2218
01:28:42,639 --> 01:28:44,400
as people will not speak out against

2219
01:28:44,400 --> 01:28:46,320
tyranny

2220
01:28:46,320 --> 01:28:47,920
as they will not

2221
01:28:47,920 --> 01:28:48,719
say

2222
01:28:48,719 --> 01:28:52,080
what is wrong and why to other people

2223
01:28:52,080 --> 01:28:55,199
expect more tyranny to encroach, expect

2224
01:28:55,199 --> 01:28:57,440
freedom to be curtailed

2225
01:28:57,440 --> 01:29:00,400
more and more, expect more slavery

2226
01:29:00,400 --> 01:29:02,800
as morality increases - freedom increases

2227
01:29:02,800 --> 01:29:05,199
as morality declines - freedom declines

2228
01:29:05,199 --> 01:29:08,080
not speaking out is a form of immorality

2229
01:29:08,080 --> 01:29:10,639
when faced with tyranny, when faced with

2230
01:29:10,639 --> 01:29:13,840
slavery, to say nothing is an act of

2231
01:29:13,840 --> 01:29:17,520
immorality in and of itself

2232
01:29:17,520 --> 01:29:19,520
let me just say that again, folks

2233
01:29:19,520 --> 01:29:22,639
when confronted with tyranny and slavery

2234
01:29:22,639 --> 01:29:25,679
not to speak using your voice

2235
01:29:25,679 --> 01:29:29,440
to say definitively the wrongness of

2236
01:29:29,440 --> 01:29:31,360
that state of existence

2237
01:29:31,360 --> 01:29:32,159
is

2238
01:29:32,159 --> 01:29:36,080
immorality in and of itself

2239
01:29:36,080 --> 01:29:38,639
not to take action in that circumstance

2240
01:29:38,639 --> 01:29:41,440
is a form of immorality

2241
01:29:41,440 --> 01:29:43,760
you are being complicit with the tyranny

2242
01:29:43,760 --> 01:29:45,840
by not using your voice to speak out

2243
01:29:45,840 --> 01:29:48,880
against it and speak truth to that form

2244
01:29:48,880 --> 01:29:50,400
of

2245
01:29:50,400 --> 01:29:53,840
absolute immoral power

2246
01:29:56,400 --> 01:29:58,719
i apologize for the background noise

2247
01:29:58,719 --> 01:30:00,400
folks, i can't control that what's going

2248
01:30:00,400 --> 01:30:02,239
on outside, hopefully that's not coming

2249
01:30:02,239 --> 01:30:04,880
through too much over the broadcast, but

2250
01:30:04,880 --> 01:30:06,639
it's a warm day here in philadelphia, i

2251
01:30:06,639 --> 01:30:07,920
do have

2252
01:30:07,920 --> 01:30:10,080
the windows open and i have the fan on

2253
01:30:10,080 --> 01:30:11,360
in here, so

2254
01:30:11,360 --> 01:30:12,960
if there is a little bit of background

2255
01:30:12,960 --> 01:30:14,960
noise i apologize for that, there's a dog

2256
01:30:14,960 --> 01:30:17,360
constantly barking outside

2257
01:30:17,360 --> 01:30:21,040
and it's kind of distracting to me

2258
01:30:21,040 --> 01:30:23,679
but anyway

2259
01:30:23,840 --> 01:30:26,560
i think, i've explained the true will to

2260
01:30:26,560 --> 01:30:30,800
my satisfaction, so, i'm going to move on

2261
01:30:32,239 --> 01:30:34,719
the phrase "do what thou wilt shall be

2262
01:30:34,719 --> 01:30:37,040
the whole of the law" is a huge

2263
01:30:37,040 --> 01:30:38,239
expression

2264
01:30:38,239 --> 01:30:40,080
in the thelemic philosophy, you hear it

2265
01:30:40,080 --> 01:30:41,600
over and over again

2266
01:30:41,600 --> 01:30:45,280
and people use this phrase completely

2267
01:30:45,280 --> 01:30:46,800
incorrectly, don't know what they're

2268
01:30:46,800 --> 01:30:49,679
talking about, to insist that

2269
01:30:49,679 --> 01:30:52,480
this is a satanic ideology

2270
01:30:52,480 --> 01:30:54,320
and thelema is basically

2271
01:30:54,320 --> 01:30:56,080
satanismб because it's saying "do whatever

2272
01:30:56,080 --> 01:30:58,320
the hell you want, there's no consequence

2273
01:30:58,320 --> 01:31:01,040
there's no law, do whatever you want"

2274
01:31:01,040 --> 01:31:03,360
wrong

2275
01:31:03,360 --> 01:31:04,960
100

2276
01:31:04,960 --> 01:31:06,000
percent

2277
01:31:06,000 --> 01:31:07,840
1000 percent

2278
01:31:07,840 --> 01:31:11,440
1 million percent - wrong

2279
01:31:11,440 --> 01:31:14,320
absolutely incorrect, if you think that

2280
01:31:14,320 --> 01:31:15,760
you don't know what the fuck you're

2281
01:31:15,760 --> 01:31:17,840
talking about

2282
01:31:17,840 --> 01:31:21,360
and yet every single solitary day i hear

2283
01:31:21,360 --> 01:31:23,520
some other fucking chump

2284
01:31:23,520 --> 01:31:25,360
say

2285
01:31:25,360 --> 01:31:26,480
"oh

2286
01:31:26,480 --> 01:31:28,719
thelema, do what thou wilt, that's

2287
01:31:28,719 --> 01:31:31,120
satanism, do whatever you want"

2288
01:31:31,120 --> 01:31:32,960
you don't know what the fuck you're

2289
01:31:32,960 --> 01:31:35,040
talking about, and i have to just say it

2290
01:31:35,040 --> 01:31:37,520
that way, i got it, i just got to come in

2291
01:31:37,520 --> 01:31:39,679
strong, just like that, just to get it

2292
01:31:39,679 --> 01:31:42,840
right out there confrontationally

2293
01:31:42,840 --> 01:31:44,480
first

2294
01:31:44,480 --> 01:31:46,400
you're wrong

2295
01:31:46,400 --> 01:31:48,400
that's not what it is

2296
01:31:48,400 --> 01:31:50,880
that's not what it means, yes, you're

2297
01:31:50,880 --> 01:31:53,360
wrong

2298
01:31:53,360 --> 01:31:56,840
it's not correct, it isn't true, you're

2299
01:31:56,840 --> 01:31:58,400
wrong

2300
01:31:58,400 --> 01:31:59,760
let's get that

2301
01:31:59,760 --> 01:32:02,639
first and foremost, out in the open, very

2302
01:32:02,639 --> 01:32:03,679
clear

2303
01:32:03,679 --> 01:32:06,480
and i've said this

2304
01:32:06,880 --> 01:32:09,440
ad nauseam amount of times, and people

2305
01:32:09,440 --> 01:32:10,840
will still

2306
01:32:10,840 --> 01:32:14,639
insist - "no, i'm right, that's satanism"

2307
01:32:14,639 --> 01:32:16,719
no, you're a dunce

2308
01:32:16,719 --> 01:32:18,400
you don't read

2309
01:32:18,400 --> 01:32:20,560
you don't understand, you don't have

2310
01:32:20,560 --> 01:32:23,040
discernment, i do

2311
01:32:23,040 --> 01:32:26,320
i'm correct

2312
01:32:26,320 --> 01:32:28,159
see

2313
01:32:28,159 --> 01:32:30,400
sometimes people just have to be told

2314
01:32:30,400 --> 01:32:31,840
like a little fucking child

2315
01:32:31,840 --> 01:32:34,480
unfortunately

2316
01:32:34,480 --> 01:32:38,000
because it's so blatantly out there in

2317
01:32:38,000 --> 01:32:41,679
all the information that a child could

2318
01:32:41,679 --> 01:32:43,920
go look it up

2319
01:32:43,920 --> 01:32:47,360
and find the incorrectness of

2320
01:32:47,360 --> 01:32:48,400
the

2321
01:32:48,400 --> 01:32:50,000
contention that

2322
01:32:50,000 --> 01:32:51,840
"do what thou wilt" means "do whatever you

2323
01:32:51,840 --> 01:32:55,920
want", and that means "thelema is satanism"

2324
01:32:55,920 --> 01:32:58,800
a fucking four-year-old can go find the

2325
01:32:58,800 --> 01:33:01,600
contradiction to that

2326
01:33:01,600 --> 01:33:04,560
that that isn't true

2327
01:33:04,719 --> 01:33:06,719
that's how much availability of

2328
01:33:06,719 --> 01:33:08,480
information there is in that regard

2329
01:33:08,480 --> 01:33:10,800
regarding this philosophy

2330
01:33:10,800 --> 01:33:12,719
and people don't do it

2331
01:33:12,719 --> 01:33:15,040
they just roll by what they heard, by

2332
01:33:15,040 --> 01:33:16,880
what somebody else told them

2333
01:33:16,880 --> 01:33:18,400
that they know nothing about from a

2334
01:33:18,400 --> 01:33:19,840
first-hand perspective, because they

2335
01:33:19,840 --> 01:33:21,679
haven't actually downloaded the material

2336
01:33:21,679 --> 01:33:23,600
and fucking read it

2337
01:33:23,600 --> 01:33:25,840
maybe that's where people should start

2338
01:33:25,840 --> 01:33:27,360
with anything

2339
01:33:27,360 --> 01:33:29,920
is downloading the source material and

2340
01:33:29,920 --> 01:33:31,679
reading it

2341
01:33:31,679 --> 01:33:33,280
god forbid

2342
01:33:33,280 --> 01:33:35,840
that involves an investment of time

2343
01:33:35,840 --> 01:33:37,120
and effort

2344
01:33:37,120 --> 01:33:39,440
we can't have that

2345
01:33:39,440 --> 01:33:40,800
can't have that

2346
01:33:40,800 --> 01:33:42,719
you gotta make a quick snap judgment on

2347
01:33:42,719 --> 01:33:44,560
what some other fucking idiot said, you

2348
01:33:44,560 --> 01:33:46,080
don't know that ?

2349
01:33:46,080 --> 01:33:48,480
that's how we roll in the 21st century

2350
01:33:48,480 --> 01:33:50,080
boy

2351
01:33:50,080 --> 01:33:52,800
we don't read

2352
01:33:59,520 --> 01:34:01,679
so, let's explain

2353
01:34:01,679 --> 01:34:04,800
to the hard heads out there what "do what

2354
01:34:04,800 --> 01:34:06,560
thou wilt shall be the whole of the law"

2355
01:34:06,560 --> 01:34:09,440
really means

2356
01:34:10,159 --> 01:34:12,800
as this dog barks incessantly during the

2357
01:34:12,800 --> 01:34:16,880
entirety of my podcast today

2358
01:34:16,880 --> 01:34:19,679
one of the main precepts of thelema is

2359
01:34:19,679 --> 01:34:21,679
"do what thou wilt shall be the whole of

2360
01:34:21,679 --> 01:34:23,280
the law"

2361
01:34:23,280 --> 01:34:24,719
this phrase

2362
01:34:24,719 --> 01:34:26,239
is almost...

2363
01:34:26,239 --> 01:34:28,719
is almost always

2364
01:34:28,719 --> 01:34:31,360
completely misunderstood and taken out

2365
01:34:31,360 --> 01:34:33,760
of context

2366
01:34:33,760 --> 01:34:35,600
understood correctly

2367
01:34:35,600 --> 01:34:39,040
this most certainly does not mean "do

2368
01:34:39,040 --> 01:34:41,280
whatever you want", in a purely selfish

2369
01:34:41,280 --> 01:34:42,880
context

2370
01:34:42,880 --> 01:34:44,639
"do what thou wilt shall be the whole of

2371
01:34:44,639 --> 01:34:47,280
the law" refers to the true will

2372
01:34:47,280 --> 01:34:49,520
which we just talked about, was an

2373
01:34:49,520 --> 01:34:52,320
alignment of one's personal path of

2374
01:34:52,320 --> 01:34:55,679
action in life to higher universal

2375
01:34:55,679 --> 01:34:57,840
spiritual natural law

2376
01:34:57,840 --> 01:35:01,040
meaning if you align one's

2377
01:35:01,040 --> 01:35:03,760
own will with the will of creation - that

2378
01:35:03,760 --> 01:35:06,159
is the whole will of the law, that is the

2379
01:35:06,159 --> 01:35:08,480
whole of the law

2380
01:35:08,480 --> 01:35:10,800
that is ultimately what

2381
01:35:10,800 --> 01:35:13,360
the expression of natural law and the

2382
01:35:13,360 --> 01:35:16,159
intelligence, the intelligent ordering

2383
01:35:16,159 --> 01:35:17,119
force

2384
01:35:17,119 --> 01:35:21,040
of justice in the cosmos, is attempting

2385
01:35:21,040 --> 01:35:22,960
to achieve

2386
01:35:22,960 --> 01:35:24,800
and it's what it wants

2387
01:35:24,800 --> 01:35:27,760
us to do with our lives to find that

2388
01:35:27,760 --> 01:35:31,679
purpose, and walk that path of action

2389
01:35:31,679 --> 01:35:35,520
express it through our behaviors

2390
01:35:36,400 --> 01:35:38,000
"do what thou wilt shall be the whole of

2391
01:35:38,000 --> 01:35:40,639
the law" refers to the true will, one's

2392
01:35:40,639 --> 01:35:43,199
wholly aligned spiritual path in life

2393
01:35:43,199 --> 01:35:45,520
upon which we are guided once we have

2394
01:35:45,520 --> 01:35:47,040
learned to hear and follow the higher

2395
01:35:47,040 --> 01:35:51,199
self, again, in thelema

2396
01:35:51,199 --> 01:35:52,880
the true will

2397
01:35:52,880 --> 01:35:53,760
and

2398
01:35:53,760 --> 01:35:56,639
"doing what thou wilt" meaning "doing the

2399
01:35:56,639 --> 01:36:00,400
true will", not the selfish will

2400
01:36:00,400 --> 01:36:04,880
see, "do what thou wilt" capital "w"-will

2401
01:36:04,880 --> 01:36:07,280
would be

2402
01:36:07,360 --> 01:36:10,239
symbolically and allegorically expressed

2403
01:36:10,239 --> 01:36:13,040
as the magus card of the thoth tarot

2404
01:36:13,040 --> 01:36:16,239
deck, crowley's own personal tarot deck

2405
01:36:16,239 --> 01:36:20,080
that he appointed to be paint{-ed / it}

2406
01:36:20,080 --> 01:36:22,560
this is the magician card in the

2407
01:36:22,560 --> 01:36:24,800
traditional tarot deck

2408
01:36:24,800 --> 01:36:27,440
crowley refers to it as the magus

2409
01:36:27,440 --> 01:36:28,719
which is

2410
01:36:28,719 --> 01:36:32,080
latin for magician

2411
01:36:35,360 --> 01:36:36,480
and

2412
01:36:36,480 --> 01:36:38,560
you know, you could see he has the 4

2413
01:36:38,560 --> 01:36:40,880
elements there

2414
01:36:40,880 --> 01:36:43,119
and then

2415
01:36:43,119 --> 01:36:44,639
the 5th element

2416
01:36:44,639 --> 01:36:46,880
expressed as

2417
01:36:46,880 --> 01:36:50,560
his crown chakra exploding with the

2418
01:36:50,560 --> 01:36:53,840
serpentine energy

2419
01:36:53,840 --> 01:36:56,080
up to the grail and

2420
01:36:56,080 --> 01:36:59,280
the wings of ma'at

2421
01:36:59,520 --> 01:37:00,800
a lot of

2422
01:37:00,800 --> 01:37:02,960
alchemical symbolism, a lot of egyptian

2423
01:37:02,960 --> 01:37:04,880
symbolism in

2424
01:37:04,880 --> 01:37:07,280
crowley's thoth deck

2425
01:37:07,280 --> 01:37:10,159
you see, then the

2426
01:37:10,159 --> 01:37:12,719
baboon creature

2427
01:37:12,719 --> 01:37:14,880
in the background there, reaching up to

2428
01:37:14,880 --> 01:37:17,119
try to reach the magus and, maybe

2429
01:37:17,119 --> 01:37:21,360
possibly pull him down from his

2430
01:37:21,360 --> 01:37:23,119
perch there

2431
01:37:23,119 --> 01:37:26,400
and that represents our base desires

2432
01:37:26,400 --> 01:37:28,960
which we have to tame, they're always

2433
01:37:28,960 --> 01:37:31,280
there, they're not gone

2434
01:37:31,280 --> 01:37:32,719
permanently

2435
01:37:32,719 --> 01:37:36,719
but we keep them under control

2436
01:37:36,960 --> 01:37:37,840
and

2437
01:37:37,840 --> 01:37:40,320
we don't allow them to pull us down from

2438
01:37:40,320 --> 01:37:42,480
that path that we are walking, which is

2439
01:37:42,480 --> 01:37:44,400
that thin straight line, that the magus

2440
01:37:44,400 --> 01:37:46,719
is on

2441
01:37:46,719 --> 01:37:48,320
it's beautiful symbolism, if it's

2442
01:37:48,320 --> 01:37:50,639
understood, if it's not understood - people

2443
01:37:50,639 --> 01:37:52,960
go - "oh, it's a guy standing there with

2444
01:37:52,960 --> 01:37:56,560
like a cop, and a dagger", and

2445
01:37:56,560 --> 01:37:58,320
yeah, they don't, they don't grasp what

2446
01:37:58,320 --> 01:37:59,600
they're seeing

2447
01:37:59,600 --> 01:38:01,760
because this is what people who aren't

2448
01:38:01,760 --> 01:38:04,400
literate in occult symbolism do, they see

2449
01:38:04,400 --> 01:38:06,400
things at just face value and they have

2450
01:38:06,400 --> 01:38:10,400
no idea what any of this represents

2451
01:38:10,719 --> 01:38:11,920
you know, you have

2452
01:38:11,920 --> 01:38:14,719
swords, wands, cups and coins, the 4

2453
01:38:14,719 --> 01:38:16,960
suits of the tarot, the 4 alchemical

2454
01:38:16,960 --> 01:38:18,000
elements

2455
01:38:18,000 --> 01:38:20,719
coins representing earth

2456
01:38:20,719 --> 01:38:22,400
resources

2457
01:38:22,400 --> 01:38:26,320
bodily characteristics etcetera

2458
01:38:29,199 --> 01:38:32,719
we have the intellect represented by

2459
01:38:32,719 --> 01:38:35,119
the sword

2460
01:38:35,119 --> 01:38:36,480
or the dagger

2461
01:38:36,480 --> 01:38:38,000
in this case

2462
01:38:38,000 --> 01:38:40,480
the wand

2463
01:38:40,480 --> 01:38:43,119
the cup representing of our emotions

2464
01:38:43,119 --> 01:38:44,800
our emotional intelligence and heart

2465
01:38:44,800 --> 01:38:46,320
based intelligence

2466
01:38:46,320 --> 01:38:48,320
and then, of course, the

2467
01:38:48,320 --> 01:38:51,760
wand representing the will

2468
01:38:51,840 --> 01:38:54,239
fire

2469
01:38:54,239 --> 01:38:57,119
so, air would be the intellect, the dagger

2470
01:38:57,119 --> 01:38:59,440
water - the cup, obviously

2471
01:38:59,440 --> 01:39:01,440
which holds water

2472
01:39:01,440 --> 01:39:03,280
representing the emotions

2473
01:39:03,280 --> 01:39:08,000
and then fire, the wand, which is action

2474
01:39:09,840 --> 01:39:11,840
we broke that down pretty extensively

2475
01:39:11,840 --> 01:39:14,159
when we covered tarot

2476
01:39:14,159 --> 01:39:15,040
and the

2477
01:39:15,040 --> 01:39:17,280
4 suits of the tarot deck, like the

2478
01:39:17,280 --> 01:39:19,520
4 suits of the playing card, playing

2479
01:39:19,520 --> 01:39:21,920
card deck

2480
01:39:21,920 --> 01:39:24,400
and the magus wields

2481
01:39:24,400 --> 01:39:26,639
all of these tools

2482
01:39:26,639 --> 01:39:29,679
because he's

2483
01:39:29,840 --> 01:39:32,320
attained self-mastery over the base

2484
01:39:32,320 --> 01:39:34,159
desires to walk the path of the true

2485
01:39:34,159 --> 01:39:34,960
will

2486
01:39:34,960 --> 01:39:38,159
and be the servant of creation, and

2487
01:39:38,159 --> 01:39:41,440
fulfill natural law

2488
01:39:41,440 --> 01:39:42,480
hence

2489
01:39:42,480 --> 01:39:44,719
"do what thou wilt is the whole of the

2490
01:39:44,719 --> 01:39:46,960
law"

2491
01:39:47,920 --> 01:39:49,760
brilliant symbolism

2492
01:39:49,760 --> 01:39:52,000
i like how he puts the baboon creature

2493
01:39:52,000 --> 01:39:54,320
in there to represent

2494
01:39:54,320 --> 01:39:56,239
the base desires aren't

2495
01:39:56,239 --> 01:39:57,760
going anywhere, they're still

2496
01:39:57,760 --> 01:39:59,440
there

2497
01:39:59,440 --> 01:40:02,560
we have to achieve

2498
01:40:02,560 --> 01:40:05,440
ownership over them

2499
01:40:05,440 --> 01:40:09,840
and not let them own us

2500
01:40:10,400 --> 01:40:11,280
i

2501
01:40:11,280 --> 01:40:13,040
like some of the things that someone

2502
01:40:13,040 --> 01:40:15,520
like jordan peterson says, i wouldn't say

2503
01:40:15,520 --> 01:40:16,639
he has a

2504
01:40:16,639 --> 01:40:18,480
total understanding, especially not of

2505
01:40:18,480 --> 01:40:20,400
the occult

2506
01:40:20,400 --> 01:40:23,760
philosophies out there and

2507
01:40:23,760 --> 01:40:25,440
definitely, doesn't understand the power

2508
01:40:25,440 --> 01:40:26,960
structure of the world as it truly

2509
01:40:26,960 --> 01:40:28,719
exists

2510
01:40:28,719 --> 01:40:30,880
but one thing he said is

2511
01:40:30,880 --> 01:40:32,800
that i liked which

2512
01:40:32,800 --> 01:40:34,719
talked about this, restraining of the

2513
01:40:34,719 --> 01:40:36,880
base instincts

2514
01:40:36,880 --> 01:40:40,320
he has a quote out there, that says

2515
01:40:42,480 --> 01:40:44,320
a good man

2516
01:40:44,320 --> 01:40:47,280
he says

2517
01:40:47,280 --> 01:40:48,480
a man who

2518
01:40:48,480 --> 01:40:51,119
isn't dangerous - isn't a good man, you

2519
01:40:51,119 --> 01:40:53,600
know, a truly good man is a very

2520
01:40:53,600 --> 01:40:56,400
dangerous man, who has it

2521
01:40:56,400 --> 01:40:59,440
under his voluntary control

2522
01:40:59,440 --> 01:41:01,360
i may be paraphrasing slightly, but

2523
01:41:01,360 --> 01:41:03,199
essentially that's it

2524
01:41:03,199 --> 01:41:04,880
a truly good man

2525
01:41:04,880 --> 01:41:08,239
is actually a very dangerous man

2526
01:41:08,239 --> 01:41:11,520
has the potential for great

2527
01:41:11,520 --> 01:41:13,280
destructive behavior, great violent

2528
01:41:13,280 --> 01:41:16,560
behavior or self-defensive behavior, if

2529
01:41:16,560 --> 01:41:18,560
you would

2530
01:41:18,560 --> 01:41:21,199
but he's keeping that under his

2531
01:41:21,199 --> 01:41:24,320
voluntary control

2532
01:41:24,320 --> 01:41:27,520
that potential danger, that he represents

2533
01:41:27,520 --> 01:41:31,960
that's actually always a potential

2534
01:41:37,600 --> 01:41:40,000
let's move on

2535
01:41:40,000 --> 01:41:41,440
and, you know, just let me step back for a

2536
01:41:41,440 --> 01:41:44,080
moment, the part that

2537
01:41:44,080 --> 01:41:48,080
we're guided on the path of the will

2538
01:41:48,080 --> 01:41:51,440
toward our purpose

2539
01:41:51,440 --> 01:41:53,360
once we've learned to hear and follow

2540
01:41:53,360 --> 01:41:55,920
the higher self, again, that is

2541
01:41:55,920 --> 01:41:58,719
what's made possible through meditative

2542
01:41:58,719 --> 01:42:01,440
tantric

2543
01:42:01,440 --> 01:42:02,719
breathing

2544
01:42:04,239 --> 01:42:07,360
yogic practices etcetera

2545
01:42:07,360 --> 01:42:09,840
and there's many other methods

2546
01:42:09,840 --> 01:42:12,560
psychedelics could be one, if you do it

2547
01:42:12,560 --> 01:42:15,560
properly

2548
01:42:15,600 --> 01:42:17,040
some people would consider them

2549
01:42:17,040 --> 01:42:19,600
shortcuts, some people see them as tools

2550
01:42:19,600 --> 01:42:22,560
in a different sense

2551
01:42:22,560 --> 01:42:24,400
but that voice doesn't speak above a

2552
01:42:24,400 --> 01:42:26,239
whisper

2553
01:42:26,239 --> 01:42:28,239
our chatter is yapping away at a million

2554
01:42:28,239 --> 01:42:30,800
miles an hour at top volume

2555
01:42:30,800 --> 01:42:32,400
in our minds

2556
01:42:32,400 --> 01:42:34,480
you know

2557
01:42:35,840 --> 01:42:37,679
it's the thing where

2558
01:42:37,679 --> 01:42:38,480
like

2559
01:42:38,480 --> 01:42:41,040
you really ask people what they believe

2560
01:42:41,040 --> 01:42:43,520
and they say some of the most

2561
01:42:43,520 --> 01:42:46,000
contradictory nonsensical things about

2562
01:42:46,000 --> 01:42:47,920
what they believe is going on, happening

2563
01:42:47,920 --> 01:42:49,920
what they need to do, when you just sit

2564
01:42:49,920 --> 01:42:51,520
them down and say

2565
01:42:51,520 --> 01:42:55,040
"really be in the room with that thought

2566
01:42:55,040 --> 01:42:57,600
really focus on it

2567
01:42:57,600 --> 01:42:59,920
sit in front of the mirror, and tell it

2568
01:42:59,920 --> 01:43:01,360
to yourself

2569
01:43:01,360 --> 01:43:03,520
like you're trying to get the other

2570
01:43:03,520 --> 01:43:06,080
image to believe you

2571
01:43:06,080 --> 01:43:09,760
and you'll realize how full of shit

2572
01:43:09,760 --> 01:43:13,440
most of us are all day, every day

2573
01:43:13,440 --> 01:43:17,199
every second of the day"

2574
01:43:17,280 --> 01:43:19,440
this is what these practices

2575
01:43:19,440 --> 01:43:21,520
that are part of thelemic practices are

2576
01:43:21,520 --> 01:43:22,719
about

2577
01:43:22,719 --> 01:43:24,800
it's about having that conversation with

2578
01:43:24,800 --> 01:43:26,400
the self, and really have the

2579
01:43:26,400 --> 01:43:28,000
conversation - "am i doing what i'm

2580
01:43:28,000 --> 01:43:29,520
supposed to be doing ?

2581
01:43:29,520 --> 01:43:32,960
am i a coward ? am i on the path and do i

2582
01:43:32,960 --> 01:43:35,119
have really have a purpose in life ? am i

2583
01:43:35,119 --> 01:43:37,360
fulfilling it ?"

2584
01:43:37,360 --> 01:43:40,800
i can honestly sit there and say

2585
01:43:40,800 --> 01:43:44,320
i've asked myself those questions, i've

2586
01:43:44,320 --> 01:43:46,800
had the conversation in the mirror over

2587
01:43:46,800 --> 01:43:48,480
and over, and over, and over, and over

2588
01:43:48,480 --> 01:43:50,800
again

2589
01:43:50,960 --> 01:43:52,480
i've conquered

2590
01:43:52,480 --> 01:43:54,960
to the extent, that they're not owning me

2591
01:43:54,960 --> 01:43:57,360
those base desires, and fears, and

2592
01:43:57,360 --> 01:44:01,040
contradictions, not to do the

2593
01:44:01,040 --> 01:44:02,400
the great work

2594
01:44:02,400 --> 01:44:04,400
not to get on the path of the true will

2595
01:44:04,400 --> 01:44:07,040
and i'm truly on it, i could say it

2596
01:44:07,040 --> 01:44:09,679
honestly, i can answer that honestly

2597
01:44:09,679 --> 01:44:11,840
how many people can ?!

2598
01:44:11,840 --> 01:44:14,480
most people, you are

2599
01:44:14,480 --> 01:44:17,280
constantly lying to yourself, you're

2600
01:44:17,280 --> 01:44:20,880
constantly saying bullshit to yourself

2601
01:44:20,880 --> 01:44:23,520
and trying to get your ego to believe it

2602
01:44:23,520 --> 01:44:25,040
and most people will pick it up and go

2603
01:44:25,040 --> 01:44:27,600
"yeah, that's true, oh, yeah, yeah

2604
01:44:27,600 --> 01:44:31,520
i believe that, i can buy into that"

2605
01:44:31,920 --> 01:44:34,639
see, it often takes somebody confronting

2606
01:44:34,639 --> 01:44:36,480
you with your own bullshit for you to

2607
01:44:36,480 --> 01:44:39,920
even hear what you're telling yourself

2608
01:44:39,920 --> 01:44:42,320
you know

2609
01:44:42,400 --> 01:44:44,080
it's part of the problem, is that most

2610
01:44:44,080 --> 01:44:45,760
people don't have anybody that will do

2611
01:44:45,760 --> 01:44:46,960
that

2612
01:44:46,960 --> 01:44:48,000
people don't want to create

2613
01:44:48,000 --> 01:44:50,480
confrontative scenarios, they don't like

2614
01:44:50,480 --> 01:44:52,800
being in that state where "oh, my god, he

2615
01:44:52,800 --> 01:44:56,480
just said something that really hits home"

2616
01:44:58,000 --> 01:44:59,520
people have done it to me in the past

2617
01:44:59,520 --> 01:45:01,280
and it's been an uncomfortable situation

2618
01:45:01,280 --> 01:45:03,440
and, guess what, if it's true i look into

2619
01:45:03,440 --> 01:45:05,760
it and change, if it's not true

2620
01:45:05,760 --> 01:45:06,560
then

2621
01:45:06,560 --> 01:45:08,480
i'll say

2622
01:45:08,480 --> 01:45:10,000
that's your opinion and that's your

2623
01:45:10,000 --> 01:45:12,159
advice

2624
01:45:12,159 --> 01:45:14,480
but there is a difference between

2625
01:45:14,480 --> 01:45:16,480
being true or not

2626
01:45:16,480 --> 01:45:18,719
make no mistake about it

2627
01:45:18,719 --> 01:45:20,800
has nothing to do whether you like what

2628
01:45:20,800 --> 01:45:22,960
you're hearing or not

2629
01:45:22,960 --> 01:45:25,920
and, see, that's part of the practices of

2630
01:45:25,920 --> 01:45:28,320
thelema, when you research them look

2631
01:45:28,320 --> 01:45:29,520
into them

2632
01:45:29,520 --> 01:45:32,320
do them yourself

2633
01:45:33,040 --> 01:45:35,119
they get you to sit there with those

2634
01:45:35,119 --> 01:45:37,119
thoughts and weed them out

2635
01:45:37,119 --> 01:45:39,440
weed out the inconsistencies, weed out

2636
01:45:39,440 --> 01:45:42,400
the contradictions

2637
01:45:42,400 --> 01:45:44,320
it you eventually have a

2638
01:45:44,320 --> 01:45:46,000
conversation with yourself where you're

2639
01:45:46,000 --> 01:45:48,159
telling yourself how much bullshit

2640
01:45:48,159 --> 01:45:49,520
you've believed, you've told

2641
01:45:49,520 --> 01:45:51,119
yourself that

2642
01:45:51,119 --> 01:45:54,320
nobody else even had to tell you - you're

2643
01:45:54,320 --> 01:46:00,159
eager to tell yourself a handful bullshit and believe it

2644
01:46:00,719 --> 01:46:02,719
and "do what thou wilt shall be the whole

2645
01:46:02,719 --> 01:46:04,719
of the law" is part of

2646
01:46:04,719 --> 01:46:07,760
breaking that ego down

2647
01:46:07,760 --> 01:46:10,480
see, it's getting to hear that voice that

2648
01:46:10,480 --> 01:46:12,960
never speaks above a whisper

2649
01:46:12,960 --> 01:46:15,199
that is the connection to higher self

2650
01:46:15,199 --> 01:46:16,880
you got to get the other chatter out of

2651
01:46:16,880 --> 01:46:20,880
the mind, and there's techniques for that

2652
01:46:23,360 --> 01:46:25,440
for those called to the path of the true

2653
01:46:25,440 --> 01:46:26,880
will

2654
01:46:26,880 --> 01:46:29,199
it refers to the one great work of truth

2655
01:46:29,199 --> 01:46:30,960
love and freedom, that is what the true

2656
01:46:30,960 --> 01:46:34,639
will ultimately refers to

2657
01:46:35,679 --> 01:46:38,639
the true will is to align oneself with

2658
01:46:38,639 --> 01:46:41,119
higher will - what does the higher will of

2659
01:46:41,119 --> 01:46:44,000
creation want for all of its creatures ?

2660
01:46:44,000 --> 01:46:45,119
it wants

2661
01:46:45,119 --> 01:46:47,360
people to be free, it wants people to be

2662
01:46:47,360 --> 01:46:50,000
happy, it wants freedom from suffering

2663
01:46:50,000 --> 01:46:51,199
that is not

2664
01:46:51,199 --> 01:46:53,440
self and that is self-inflicted

2665
01:46:53,440 --> 01:46:56,239
obviously there's going to be some forms

2666
01:46:56,239 --> 01:46:58,560
of suffering contained in life, again, the

2667
01:46:58,560 --> 01:47:00,639
buddhist tradition talks about that, and

2668
01:47:00,639 --> 01:47:03,199
that's a big part of thelema, it mixes

2669
01:47:03,199 --> 01:47:05,760
some of the eastern traditions in with

2670
01:47:05,760 --> 01:47:09,280
the western mystery traditions

2671
01:47:09,280 --> 01:47:12,320
it's a very aggregate tradition, a

2672
01:47:12,320 --> 01:47:13,760
tradition with

2673
01:47:13,760 --> 01:47:14,719
which

2674
01:47:14,719 --> 01:47:17,199
coalesces a lot of other

2675
01:47:17,199 --> 01:47:18,639
mystical traditions and occult

2676
01:47:18,639 --> 01:47:20,560
traditions

2677
01:47:20,560 --> 01:47:23,840
buddhism is a big one

2678
01:47:24,159 --> 01:47:26,239
which one of the main tenets of buddhism

2679
01:47:26,239 --> 01:47:29,280
is that life contains suffering, or

2680
01:47:29,280 --> 01:47:31,440
a better way of saying it is

2681
01:47:31,440 --> 01:47:34,239
suffering is contained within life

2682
01:47:34,239 --> 01:47:37,520
the the buddhists teachings

2683
01:47:37,520 --> 01:47:38,719
never

2684
01:47:38,719 --> 01:47:41,440
anywhere in the original teachings of

2685
01:47:41,440 --> 01:47:42,719
buddhism

2686
01:47:42,719 --> 01:47:46,800
say "life is suffering", this is a total

2687
01:47:46,800 --> 01:47:50,719
total bastardization of the buddhist

2688
01:47:50,719 --> 01:47:52,880
tradition, which is a huge part of the

2689
01:47:52,880 --> 01:47:55,920
thelemic tradition

2690
01:47:56,080 --> 01:47:57,679
never anywhere

2691
01:47:57,679 --> 01:48:00,000
was it ever written or said

2692
01:48:00,000 --> 01:48:01,600
"life is suffering"

2693
01:48:01,600 --> 01:48:06,000
that is a bullshit new age and or

2694
01:48:06,000 --> 01:48:10,080
dark buddhist variant of the phrase

2695
01:48:10,080 --> 01:48:13,440
"suffering exists within life

2696
01:48:13,440 --> 01:48:15,920
suffering is contained within life

2697
01:48:15,920 --> 01:48:18,639
life contains suffering", it has suffering

2698
01:48:18,639 --> 01:48:19,760
within it

2699
01:48:19,760 --> 01:48:24,080
by its very essence, by its inherent

2700
01:48:24,080 --> 01:48:25,760
nature

2701
01:48:25,760 --> 01:48:27,679
living will

2702
01:48:27,679 --> 01:48:29,600
contain within it

2703
01:48:29,600 --> 01:48:31,760
certain aspects of suffering that one

2704
01:48:31,760 --> 01:48:34,400
must endure

2705
01:48:34,400 --> 01:48:37,040
and what that ultimately means is - some

2706
01:48:37,040 --> 01:48:39,520
forms of suffering are self-generated

2707
01:48:39,520 --> 01:48:41,920
some are not self-generated

2708
01:48:41,920 --> 01:48:44,159
but the overwhelming bulk majority of

2709
01:48:44,159 --> 01:48:46,719
suffering is self-generated, and if we

2710
01:48:46,719 --> 01:48:48,880
learn how not to create that suffering

2711
01:48:48,880 --> 01:48:52,080
we won't experience it

2712
01:48:52,080 --> 01:48:54,960
it will be alleviated from us, that's the

2713
01:48:54,960 --> 01:48:56,719
the path of buddhism and

2714
01:48:56,719 --> 01:48:58,560
noble path etcetera

2715
01:48:58,560 --> 01:49:00,239
you have the noble truths and then

2716
01:49:00,239 --> 01:49:03,199
the noble paths

2717
01:49:03,520 --> 01:49:05,280
and, you know, one of the noble truths is

2718
01:49:05,280 --> 01:49:08,320
there is a method for not generating

2719
01:49:08,320 --> 01:49:12,320
those forms of self-inflicted suffering

2720
01:49:12,800 --> 01:49:15,440
and then the path shows you how to do

2721
01:49:15,440 --> 01:49:16,800
that

2722
01:49:16,800 --> 01:49:20,560
very similar to the thelemic path

2723
01:49:20,560 --> 01:49:22,320
to get on the path of the true will is

2724
01:49:22,320 --> 01:49:24,000
to begin

2725
01:49:24,000 --> 01:49:26,159
ceasing creating that self-inflicted

2726
01:49:26,159 --> 01:49:28,159
suffering by doing the great work of

2727
01:49:28,159 --> 01:49:29,920
teaching natural law, and teaching

2728
01:49:29,920 --> 01:49:31,840
objective morality, so, that it becomes

2729
01:49:31,840 --> 01:49:33,840
common sense

2730
01:49:33,840 --> 01:49:36,400
and that is you being a servant to truth

2731
01:49:36,400 --> 01:49:38,880
love and freedom

2732
01:49:38,880 --> 01:49:42,400
instead of doing whatever you want

2733
01:49:42,400 --> 01:49:44,400
and being a coward

2734
01:49:44,400 --> 01:49:46,159
and not talking out against evil and

2735
01:49:46,159 --> 01:49:48,639
tyranny

2736
01:49:49,119 --> 01:49:51,840
continuing with this paragraph

2737
01:49:51,840 --> 01:49:59,440
"do what thou wilt" in a thelemic context is literally the exact opposite of

2738
01:49:59,440 --> 01:50:02,080
the phrase "do whatever you want"

2739
01:50:02,080 --> 01:50:03,360
literally

2740
01:50:03,360 --> 01:50:07,360
dipoles, diametrically opposed opposites

2741
01:50:07,360 --> 01:50:09,599
nothing to do with each other, over here

2742
01:50:09,599 --> 01:50:11,679
is "do what thou wilt shall be the whole

2743
01:50:11,679 --> 01:50:13,440
of the law", over here is "do whatever you

2744
01:50:13,440 --> 01:50:17,280
want", and never the twain shall meet

2745
01:50:17,280 --> 01:50:20,159
complete opposites of each other

2746
01:50:20,159 --> 01:50:22,880
for anybody who truly understands it

2747
01:50:22,880 --> 01:50:25,280
for imbecile assholes, who don't know

2748
01:50:25,280 --> 01:50:26,880
what the fuck they're talking about, and

2749
01:50:26,880 --> 01:50:28,400
who insists thelema is something that

2750
01:50:28,400 --> 01:50:29,599
it is not

2751
01:50:29,599 --> 01:50:30,800
they want to

2752
01:50:30,800 --> 01:50:34,480
make them equivalents, which they are not

2753
01:50:34,480 --> 01:50:36,960
they're exactly extreme opposites of

2754
01:50:36,960 --> 01:50:39,840
each other

2755
01:50:40,800 --> 01:50:44,400
"do what thou wilt" is the apotheosis of

2756
01:50:44,400 --> 01:50:46,080
freedom

2757
01:50:46,080 --> 01:50:47,840
so, i'm continuing this sentence from the

2758
01:50:47,840 --> 01:50:49,599
one before, "do what thou wilt" in a

2759
01:50:49,599 --> 01:50:52,000
thelemic context is literally the exact

2760
01:50:52,000 --> 01:50:53,920
opposite of "do whatever you want", it is

2761
01:50:53,920 --> 01:50:56,639
the apotheosis of freedom, that means... "do

2762
01:50:56,639 --> 01:50:58,639
what thou wilt" means

2763
01:50:58,639 --> 01:51:02,560
because you are serving creation's will

2764
01:51:02,560 --> 01:51:05,040
and because ultimately that will is for

2765
01:51:05,040 --> 01:51:06,800
the freedom of all

2766
01:51:06,800 --> 01:51:08,960
for true freedom to manifest and for

2767
01:51:08,960 --> 01:51:11,520
every being to be sovereign

2768
01:51:11,520 --> 01:51:13,679
it is the elevation

2769
01:51:13,679 --> 01:51:17,040
of freedom to the position of godhood

2770
01:51:17,040 --> 01:51:19,360
that's what apotheosis means - elevation

2771
01:51:19,360 --> 01:51:20,639
to godhood

2772
01:51:20,639 --> 01:51:23,280
and, indeed, that is what truth, love and

2773
01:51:23,280 --> 01:51:26,159
freedom are - that is what god is

2774
01:51:26,159 --> 01:51:29,040
god is truth, god is love, god is freedom

2775
01:51:29,040 --> 01:51:31,599
and ultimately all 3 of those things

2776
01:51:31,599 --> 01:51:32,639
together

2777
01:51:32,639 --> 01:51:36,800
is natural law, god is law

2778
01:51:37,360 --> 01:51:39,440
that's... the law is the boundary

2779
01:51:39,440 --> 01:51:41,679
condition, you could call it

2780
01:51:41,679 --> 01:51:44,000
symbolically, represent that as a circle

2781
01:51:44,000 --> 01:51:46,239
and then put an equilateral triangle in

2782
01:51:46,239 --> 01:51:48,560
it - truth, love, freedom, again, that is why

2783
01:51:48,560 --> 01:51:51,360
the all-seeing eye design is what it is

2784
01:51:51,360 --> 01:51:53,199
that's why i use it in the one great

2785
01:51:53,199 --> 01:51:54,159
work

2786
01:51:54,159 --> 01:51:56,320
and one great work network, and what on

2787
01:51:56,320 --> 01:51:57,760
earth is happening

2788
01:51:57,760 --> 01:52:02,080
sell t-shirts with it on it etcetera

2789
01:52:02,080 --> 01:52:04,560
that's why it is the little

2790
01:52:04,560 --> 01:52:07,599
icon of the one great work network

2791
01:52:07,599 --> 01:52:09,199
because the boundary condition is

2792
01:52:09,199 --> 01:52:11,280
natural law that's, the circle, and then

2793
01:52:11,280 --> 01:52:13,599
truth, love, and freedom

2794
01:52:13,599 --> 01:52:14,960
are what it is

2795
01:52:14,960 --> 01:52:16,400
bringing into manifestation in the

2796
01:52:16,400 --> 01:52:19,040
physical world

2797
01:52:19,280 --> 01:52:21,199
that is the godhood

2798
01:52:21,199 --> 01:52:22,639
truth, love, freedom, there are the

2799
01:52:22,639 --> 01:52:24,880
expressions of it in the physical, hence

2800
01:52:24,880 --> 01:52:27,280
the triangle is the basic

2801
01:52:27,280 --> 01:52:28,639
you know

2802
01:52:28,639 --> 01:52:31,280
geometry of nature

2803
01:52:31,280 --> 01:52:33,040
and the circle

2804
01:52:33,040 --> 01:52:36,000
is the perfected shape that represents

2805
01:52:36,000 --> 01:52:37,920
the the construct

2806
01:52:37,920 --> 01:52:39,280
represents the

2807
01:52:39,280 --> 01:52:41,679
underlying ordering intelligence, that is

2808
01:52:41,679 --> 01:52:44,760
the creator

2809
01:52:45,920 --> 01:52:47,760
"do what thou wilt"

2810
01:52:47,760 --> 01:52:50,400
is the apotheosis of freedom and the

2811
01:52:50,400 --> 01:52:52,880
strictest possible bond, this is what i

2812
01:52:52,880 --> 01:52:55,280
talked about before, it's a constraint

2813
01:52:55,280 --> 01:52:57,520
it's the law

2814
01:52:57,520 --> 01:53:00,880
okay, that's what natural law is

2815
01:53:00,880 --> 01:53:03,199
and that's the bond

2816
01:53:03,199 --> 01:53:06,080
okay, you're bonded to that in life

2817
01:53:06,080 --> 01:53:08,800
meaning, it's not really an option

2818
01:53:08,800 --> 01:53:10,880
you know that end times that are not

2819
01:53:10,880 --> 01:53:12,560
equal like what we're living in a state

2820
01:53:12,560 --> 01:53:13,840
of slavery

2821
01:53:13,840 --> 01:53:15,599
you must

2822
01:53:15,599 --> 01:53:17,760
do this type of work

2823
01:53:17,760 --> 01:53:21,760
the true will doesn't have to be that

2824
01:53:21,920 --> 01:53:23,599
let's say, we were living on a planet

2825
01:53:23,599 --> 01:53:25,360
where everyone's rights were respected

2826
01:53:25,360 --> 01:53:26,880
everybody knew natural law, everybody

2827
01:53:26,880 --> 01:53:28,719
knew objective morality and align their

2828
01:53:28,719 --> 01:53:30,320
behavior to it

2829
01:53:30,320 --> 01:53:32,480
let's say, almost everybody, you're still

2830
01:53:32,480 --> 01:53:33,520
going to have

2831
01:53:33,520 --> 01:53:36,000
strayers from the path, it's

2832
01:53:36,000 --> 01:53:38,000
gonna {it's bound} to happen

2833
01:53:38,000 --> 01:53:39,599
but, let's say, we dealt with that in a

2834
01:53:39,599 --> 01:53:41,599
natural law capacity

2835
01:53:41,599 --> 01:53:43,599
meaning, we just took care of it

2836
01:53:43,599 --> 01:53:45,840
we don't build prisons

2837
01:53:45,840 --> 01:53:47,520
we don't constrain other people's rights

2838
01:53:47,520 --> 01:53:49,920
we just take care of the problem, that's

2839
01:53:49,920 --> 01:53:51,599
how it would be done in a natural law

2840
01:53:51,599 --> 01:53:54,159
society

2841
01:53:54,159 --> 01:53:56,000
you could call that brutality, if you

2842
01:53:56,000 --> 01:53:58,320
want, but, guess what, it would cleanse the

2843
01:53:58,320 --> 01:54:02,080
place of those disruptor agents

2844
01:54:02,080 --> 01:54:03,840
that want to try to get their hooks in

2845
01:54:03,840 --> 01:54:06,239
and convert other people to their

2846
01:54:06,239 --> 01:54:09,360
misery and low consciousness

2847
01:54:09,360 --> 01:54:10,880
mindset

2848
01:54:10,880 --> 01:54:14,480
you know that's exactly what it's like

2849
01:54:15,920 --> 01:54:18,000
people in that deranged state of mind of

2850
01:54:18,000 --> 01:54:19,360
wanting to be controllers, it's been

2851
01:54:19,360 --> 01:54:23,119
likened like a sick person on a

2852
01:54:23,119 --> 01:54:25,360
being carried on on a gurney, and

2853
01:54:25,360 --> 01:54:26,960
attacking all the people that are

2854
01:54:26,960 --> 01:54:29,520
holding him up on

2855
01:54:29,520 --> 01:54:30,560
the

2856
01:54:30,560 --> 01:54:31,920
thing that they're carrying them on to

2857
01:54:31,920 --> 01:54:35,280
get him to a hospital

2858
01:54:35,360 --> 01:54:37,199
that's what they do, the sick then

2859
01:54:37,199 --> 01:54:38,960
attacks and make harms other people and

2860
01:54:38,960 --> 01:54:42,719
makes them tries to make them like him

2861
01:54:42,719 --> 01:54:44,080
that's what the whole

2862
01:54:44,080 --> 01:54:46,400
dark occult mindset is and does, that's

2863
01:54:46,400 --> 01:54:50,760
what the psychopath is and does

2864
01:54:52,239 --> 01:54:54,719
so, if we lived on a place that...

2865
01:54:54,719 --> 01:54:56,800
in a place that already understood

2866
01:54:56,800 --> 01:54:59,199
natural law, and we didn't have to worry

2867
01:54:59,199 --> 01:55:01,040
about the total

2868
01:55:01,040 --> 01:55:02,960
destruction of our rights

2869
01:55:02,960 --> 01:55:05,520
and we essentially lived every day with

2870
01:55:05,520 --> 01:55:08,000
our rights intact, the true will would

2871
01:55:08,000 --> 01:55:10,639
not have to be

2872
01:55:10,639 --> 01:55:13,360
doing this work all the time

2873
01:55:13,360 --> 01:55:14,960
you would have this work out there

2874
01:55:14,960 --> 01:55:17,440
naturally in the course of the knowledge

2875
01:55:17,440 --> 01:55:19,440
of the people of the planet

2876
01:55:19,440 --> 01:55:21,920
it would have to be that way for that

2877
01:55:21,920 --> 01:55:25,679
condition to manifest in the first place

2878
01:55:26,239 --> 01:55:28,480
so, then, hey, what if i wanted to become a

2879
01:55:28,480 --> 01:55:31,360
master sculptor ?

2880
01:55:31,360 --> 01:55:33,599
i could turn my will over to that, that

2881
01:55:33,599 --> 01:55:36,320
could be my path in life, that may be my

2882
01:55:36,320 --> 01:55:38,719
purpose to express beauty and

2883
01:55:38,719 --> 01:55:41,360
potentiality of what a human being could

2884
01:55:41,360 --> 01:55:44,560
do in something like that

2885
01:55:44,560 --> 01:55:47,199
maybe, i want to invent some new piece

2886
01:55:47,199 --> 01:55:49,440
of technology

2887
01:55:49,440 --> 01:55:52,800
and that could be my true will

2888
01:55:53,040 --> 01:55:56,000
so, when i say at a time

2889
01:55:56,000 --> 01:55:59,360
when all things are equal

2890
01:55:59,520 --> 01:56:02,400
again, when they're not equal

2891
01:56:02,400 --> 01:56:05,040
and we're living as if some people are

2892
01:56:05,040 --> 01:56:06,960
gods and other people are their slaves

2893
01:56:06,960 --> 01:56:09,840
like we are now

2894
01:56:10,560 --> 01:56:12,400
the true will of

2895
01:56:12,400 --> 01:56:14,800
just about everyone

2896
01:56:14,800 --> 01:56:16,880
is constrained

2897
01:56:16,880 --> 01:56:20,159
it's a bond, it gets bound up

2898
01:56:20,159 --> 01:56:22,320
and it all comes together

2899
01:56:22,320 --> 01:56:23,520
where

2900
01:56:23,520 --> 01:56:26,080
you don't have that potentiality to say

2901
01:56:26,080 --> 01:56:27,679
"i'm going to go be that master sculptor

2902
01:56:27,679 --> 01:56:29,360
or that master painter, or that master

2903
01:56:29,360 --> 01:56:33,760
musician, or that master inventor"

2904
01:56:33,760 --> 01:56:35,760
if you simply go and then follow that

2905
01:56:35,760 --> 01:56:38,400
path - that's not the true will

2906
01:56:38,400 --> 01:56:40,639
because the true will has to align with

2907
01:56:40,639 --> 01:56:42,159
one's...

2908
01:56:42,159 --> 01:56:45,360
with the will of creation

2909
01:56:45,360 --> 01:56:47,760
on a planet, where

2910
01:56:47,760 --> 01:56:50,639
rights are intact

2911
01:56:50,639 --> 01:56:52,960
someone going inventing something new to

2912
01:56:52,960 --> 01:56:55,119
help bring higher expressions of

2913
01:56:55,119 --> 01:56:58,719
consciousness potentiality

2914
01:56:58,800 --> 01:57:01,760
the development of the species to

2915
01:57:01,760 --> 01:57:03,040
higher

2916
01:57:03,040 --> 01:57:06,159
levels of complexity etcetera

2917
01:57:06,159 --> 01:57:08,880
would be the will of creation

2918
01:57:08,880 --> 01:57:10,960
for a planet, whose people don't

2919
01:57:10,960 --> 01:57:13,119
understand rights, don't understand what

2920
01:57:13,119 --> 01:57:15,040
a right is, what a wrong is, what natural

2921
01:57:15,040 --> 01:57:16,400
law is

2922
01:57:16,400 --> 01:57:18,560
why we shouldn't be enslaving each other

2923
01:57:18,560 --> 01:57:20,800
why there shouldn't be government at all

2924
01:57:20,800 --> 01:57:24,000
for a planet that ignorant

2925
01:57:24,000 --> 01:57:25,760
the true will

2926
01:57:25,760 --> 01:57:27,360
of all

2927
01:57:27,360 --> 01:57:30,800
is to first get that planet and all the

2928
01:57:30,800 --> 01:57:33,440
people on it to that base level of

2929
01:57:33,440 --> 01:57:35,199
understanding of

2930
01:57:35,199 --> 01:57:38,639
morality and natural law

2931
01:57:38,639 --> 01:57:39,760
so

2932
01:57:39,760 --> 01:57:43,199
where we're at now on this planet

2933
01:57:43,199 --> 01:57:44,800
that we call earth

2934
01:57:44,800 --> 01:57:46,960
which is a hell world

2935
01:57:46,960 --> 01:57:50,960
it has devolved into a hell world

2936
01:57:51,199 --> 01:57:55,199
there really is only one true will

2937
01:57:55,199 --> 01:57:57,840
because to follow any other path than

2938
01:57:57,840 --> 01:58:00,639
the one that would create truth, love

2939
01:58:00,639 --> 01:58:03,040
freedom

2940
01:58:03,679 --> 01:58:07,840
is to go against the will of creation

2941
01:58:08,560 --> 01:58:10,800
and, i can say, i understand that, i can

2942
01:58:10,800 --> 01:58:13,280
say, that's a true statement, most people will

2943
01:58:13,280 --> 01:58:15,520
say "oh, that's what you think"

2944
01:58:15,520 --> 01:58:19,119
no, it's what i've come to understand

2945
01:58:19,119 --> 01:58:21,599
if you just give it some thought, quietly

2946
01:58:21,599 --> 01:58:24,639
alone, and really deeply contemplate it

2947
01:58:24,639 --> 01:58:26,320
you'll understand

2948
01:58:26,320 --> 01:58:27,520
right now

2949
01:58:27,520 --> 01:58:29,440
not to do the true will

2950
01:58:29,440 --> 01:58:32,400
of the one great work

2951
01:58:32,400 --> 01:58:35,440
is literally telling creation

2952
01:58:35,440 --> 01:58:38,639
to go of itself

2953
01:58:40,386 --> 01:58:41,520
as jordan maxwell said

2954
01:58:41,520 --> 01:58:45,840
you are screwing with cosmic justice

2955
01:58:45,840 --> 01:58:48,560
and screwing with cosmic justice is only

2956
01:58:48,560 --> 01:58:50,400
going to bring anybody, that does that

2957
01:58:50,400 --> 01:58:54,400
one thing - cosmic judgment

2958
01:58:56,159 --> 01:59:00,000
again, that's the law of freedom

2959
01:59:00,639 --> 01:59:03,040
not teaching morality and natural law in

2960
01:59:03,040 --> 01:59:06,080
a place where we're already enslaved

2961
01:59:06,080 --> 01:59:08,000
is complicity with the evil, that's

2962
01:59:08,000 --> 01:59:11,440
already in control here

2963
01:59:12,000 --> 01:59:14,159
that's why so many people's lives can't

2964
01:59:14,159 --> 01:59:16,159
flow effortlessly

2965
01:59:16,159 --> 01:59:18,639
and there's so little prosperity

2966
01:59:18,639 --> 01:59:20,560
in most people's lives

2967
01:59:20,560 --> 01:59:22,960
because we've let such injustice and

2968
01:59:22,960 --> 01:59:26,239
iniquities, and evil breed everywhere all

2969
01:59:26,239 --> 01:59:28,960
around us

2970
01:59:29,119 --> 01:59:34,400
{with / we} largely unchallenged running a muck

2971
01:59:35,679 --> 01:59:37,360
{do} you think the universe is going to

2972
01:59:37,360 --> 01:59:40,400
give us what we say, we want selfishly ?

2973
01:59:40,400 --> 01:59:43,599
with the lower case will, "w", lowercase "w"

2974
01:59:43,599 --> 01:59:44,719
will

2975
01:59:44,719 --> 01:59:47,040
when we're not serving the higher case "w"

2976
01:59:47,040 --> 01:59:48,239
will

2977
01:59:48,239 --> 01:59:49,119
and

2978
01:59:49,119 --> 01:59:51,440
people think we deserve anything better

2979
01:59:51,440 --> 01:59:53,280
than what we have ? they think, they

2980
01:59:53,280 --> 01:59:54,960
personally deserve anything better than

2981
01:59:54,960 --> 01:59:57,280
what they have

2982
01:59:57,280 --> 01:59:59,520
that's the exact reason we're in this

2983
01:59:59,520 --> 02:00:00,480
place

2984
02:00:00,480 --> 02:00:02,560
is because so many people selfishly

2985
02:00:02,560 --> 02:00:04,400
choose to do what they want to do for

2986
02:00:04,400 --> 02:00:07,199
themselves, because it's more comfortable

2987
02:00:07,199 --> 02:00:08,960
because they don't really want freedom

2988
02:00:08,960 --> 02:00:10,400
they don't really want truth, they don't

2989
02:00:10,400 --> 02:00:12,560
really want love, they want what they

2990
02:00:12,560 --> 02:00:14,480
want for themselves

2991
02:00:14,480 --> 02:00:17,920
which is being a selfish prick

2992
02:00:17,920 --> 02:00:21,040
that's called being a selfish prick

2993
02:00:21,040 --> 02:00:23,119
that's not doing the one great work

2994
02:00:23,119 --> 02:00:25,920
that's not doing the true will

2995
02:00:25,920 --> 02:00:27,440
certainly not advancing the will of

2996
02:00:27,440 --> 02:00:28,560
creation

2997
02:00:28,560 --> 02:00:30,880
it's advancing the selfish will of the

2998
02:00:30,880 --> 02:00:32,239
individual

2999
02:00:32,239 --> 02:00:34,080
once again, i have a selfish will

3000
02:00:34,080 --> 02:00:36,639
everybody does - who doesn't ?

3001
02:00:36,639 --> 02:00:39,679
wonderful - who cares ?

3002
02:00:39,679 --> 02:00:42,239
that's like saying somebody, you know, has

3003
02:00:42,239 --> 02:00:44,080
an anus, everybody does

3004
02:00:44,080 --> 02:00:47,520
you know, everybody's got a mouth

3005
02:00:52,719 --> 02:00:55,119
the whole point is

3006
02:00:55,119 --> 02:00:58,320
that doesn't make you unique

3007
02:00:58,320 --> 02:01:00,320
getting a handle on that, so, that it

3008
02:01:00,320 --> 02:01:02,400
doesn't control you, will make you unique

3009
02:01:02,400 --> 02:01:04,639
that'll put you on the path

3010
02:01:04,639 --> 02:01:06,080
to mastery

3011
02:01:06,080 --> 02:01:08,400
and, again, it's not about being perfect

3012
02:01:08,400 --> 02:01:10,159
it's not about leading an ascetic

3013
02:01:10,159 --> 02:01:14,159
lifestyle, when you shun every pleasure

3014
02:01:14,159 --> 02:01:17,679
by no means is that my life

3015
02:01:17,679 --> 02:01:20,560
it means you make doing the true will

3016
02:01:20,560 --> 02:01:22,880
you make doing the one great work

3017
02:01:22,880 --> 02:01:25,199
the most important aspect of your life

3018
02:01:25,199 --> 02:01:28,960
and everything is secondary to it

3019
02:01:29,040 --> 02:01:30,719
because if you're not doing that you're

3020
02:01:30,719 --> 02:01:32,480
not living a purpose-driven life and

3021
02:01:32,480 --> 02:01:33,920
you're certainly not fulfilling your

3022
02:01:33,920 --> 02:01:35,520
true will

3023
02:01:35,520 --> 02:01:38,080
especially, on a planet that is as fucked

3024
02:01:38,080 --> 02:01:40,639
up as this one

3025
02:01:40,639 --> 02:01:42,639
to go and just turn away from doing that

3026
02:01:42,639 --> 02:01:46,639
will and go live your selfish will

3027
02:01:46,639 --> 02:01:49,199
really, really does put you in a bad

3028
02:01:49,199 --> 02:01:51,840
karmic place

3029
02:01:52,159 --> 02:01:54,400
and in a terrible position as a human

3030
02:01:54,400 --> 02:01:56,320
being

3031
02:01:56,320 --> 02:01:57,840
and you still can't get people to

3032
02:01:57,840 --> 02:01:59,360
understand that, they're still going to

3033
02:01:59,360 --> 02:02:01,280
live their selfish lives, their selfish

3034
02:02:01,280 --> 02:02:04,080
ways, because they're ignorant, they're

3035
02:02:04,080 --> 02:02:05,599
apathetic

3036
02:02:05,599 --> 02:02:07,920
they're cowardly, and they're lazy - the

3037
02:02:07,920 --> 02:02:10,800
four murderers of consciousness

3038
02:02:10,800 --> 02:02:15,280
ignorance, apathy, laziness, cowardice

3039
02:02:15,599 --> 02:02:18,159
they have such an abundance of one or

3040
02:02:18,159 --> 02:02:19,520
all of them

3041
02:02:19,520 --> 02:02:23,119
one or more or all of those murderers of

3042
02:02:23,119 --> 02:02:25,440
consciousness that they cannot come out

3043
02:02:25,440 --> 02:02:27,840
of that lower state of consciousness

3044
02:02:27,840 --> 02:02:29,040
something

3045
02:02:29,040 --> 02:02:33,119
in some form of trauma is holding them

3046
02:02:33,119 --> 02:02:33,920
there

3047
02:02:33,920 --> 02:02:36,159
it's like a weight on top of

3048
02:02:36,159 --> 02:02:37,599
them, it's like something that has them

3049
02:02:37,599 --> 02:02:39,199
it's like a cage

3050
02:02:39,199 --> 02:02:42,480
we're going to talk about the head cage

3051
02:02:42,480 --> 02:02:46,920
a little bit later in this presentation

3052
02:02:47,760 --> 02:02:51,360
and that is what's binding them

3053
02:02:51,360 --> 02:02:53,440
they're not bound to

3054
02:02:53,440 --> 02:02:56,560
creation's law, they're not bound to

3055
02:02:56,560 --> 02:03:00,320
truly "do what thou wilt"

3056
02:03:00,320 --> 02:03:01,520
they're letting

3057
02:03:01,520 --> 02:03:03,199
that baboon creature, there in the

3058
02:03:03,199 --> 02:03:05,199
background, bind them

3059
02:03:05,199 --> 02:03:07,920
the selfish desire, the ignorance

3060
02:03:07,920 --> 02:03:10,159
the laziness

3061
02:03:10,159 --> 02:03:13,119
big time the cowardice, it's a big one

3062
02:03:13,119 --> 02:03:16,000
that stops everybody

3063
02:03:16,000 --> 02:03:18,560
i don't want to put my voice out there

3064
02:03:18,560 --> 02:03:20,639
i don't want to put a target on myself, i

3065
02:03:20,639 --> 02:03:22,239
don't want other people to see me, i

3066
02:03:22,239 --> 02:03:24,560
don't want other people to hear me

3067
02:03:24,560 --> 02:03:26,480
just so much

3068
02:03:26,480 --> 02:03:28,480
fucking fear

3069
02:03:28,480 --> 02:03:30,639
it's pathetic

3070
02:03:30,639 --> 02:03:34,320
it's fucking pathetic

3071
02:03:36,400 --> 02:03:38,639
and, you know what ? the bigger fear that

3072
02:03:38,639 --> 02:03:41,360
they really should be focused on is

3073
02:03:41,360 --> 02:03:43,760
what they're actually doing to their

3074
02:03:43,760 --> 02:03:44,719
soul

3075
02:03:44,719 --> 02:03:47,440
at a cosmic level

3076
02:03:47,440 --> 02:03:50,320
by not getting involved

3077
02:03:50,320 --> 02:03:52,079
and, again, i could say this forever and

3078
02:03:52,079 --> 02:03:54,239
ever, and ever, until the end of time

3079
02:03:54,239 --> 02:03:55,599
and there are people who are still going

3080
02:03:55,599 --> 02:03:58,000
to just say - fuck it, i don't care, i'm not

3081
02:03:58,000 --> 02:04:00,079
going to do it

3082
02:04:00,079 --> 02:04:01,599
that's your soul

3083
02:04:01,599 --> 02:04:04,719
that's on your soul, no one else, that's

3084
02:04:04,719 --> 02:04:07,599
on you and your soul

3085
02:04:07,599 --> 02:04:09,760
and, believe me

3086
02:04:09,760 --> 02:04:11,040
you

3087
02:04:11,040 --> 02:04:12,400
will

3088
02:04:12,400 --> 02:04:14,560
definitively

3089
02:04:14,560 --> 02:04:16,719
deal with that at some point

3090
02:04:16,719 --> 02:04:18,480
you may not deal with it in the flesh

3091
02:04:18,480 --> 02:04:21,119
and in the physical, but you're

3092
02:04:21,119 --> 02:04:22,400
gonna

3093
02:04:22,400 --> 02:04:25,840
deal with it, you will be

3094
02:04:25,840 --> 02:04:27,440
forced

3095
02:04:27,440 --> 02:04:30,239
by the universe to deal with that, and

3096
02:04:30,239 --> 02:04:33,040
confront that

3097
02:04:33,760 --> 02:04:35,760
and i don't really understand people's

3098
02:04:35,760 --> 02:04:38,480
fear like that, it makes no sense to

3099
02:04:38,480 --> 02:04:41,199
me... i'm not in that mindset

3100
02:04:41,199 --> 02:04:42,960
thankfully, it's one of the things i have

3101
02:04:42,960 --> 02:04:45,040
a lot of gratitude about, i would never

3102
02:04:45,040 --> 02:04:47,840
want to be that person, again, i look at

3103
02:04:47,840 --> 02:04:49,520
it in the

3104
02:04:49,520 --> 02:04:52,800
example, allegorically, of, you know, the

3105
02:04:52,800 --> 02:04:54,400
the movie they made about the

3106
02:04:54,400 --> 02:04:58,400
greek demigod, achilles

3107
02:04:58,560 --> 02:05:00,480
allegedly the greatest warrior of the

3108
02:05:00,480 --> 02:05:02,239
the greeks

3109
02:05:02,239 --> 02:05:04,400
who's gonna go into battle against the

3110
02:05:04,400 --> 02:05:06,400
enemies of the greek empire

3111
02:05:06,400 --> 02:05:07,360
and

3112
02:05:07,360 --> 02:05:09,280
he's getting ready to go into battle, i

3113
02:05:09,280 --> 02:05:11,440
think, possibly against persian armies

3114
02:05:11,440 --> 02:05:13,679
and

3115
02:05:13,679 --> 02:05:15,520
in the movie achilles

3116
02:05:15,520 --> 02:05:16,800
and

3117
02:05:16,800 --> 02:05:18,159
a child

3118
02:05:18,159 --> 02:05:20,880
maybe a teenager age, says to him - aren't

3119
02:05:20,880 --> 02:05:22,320
you afraid ?

3120
02:05:22,320 --> 02:05:25,599
and he goes - no, i'm not afraid

3121
02:05:25,599 --> 02:05:28,400
and, because he knows what he has to do

3122
02:05:28,400 --> 02:05:30,560
he knows the forces he has to confront

3123
02:05:30,560 --> 02:05:32,719
he knows, he has to go into battle, and

3124
02:05:32,719 --> 02:05:34,239
it's an allegory to go into

3125
02:05:34,239 --> 02:05:36,320
spiritual battle

3126
02:05:36,320 --> 02:05:39,840
and he says - no, i am not afraid

3127
02:05:39,920 --> 02:05:42,320
and the the kid, he's talking with the

3128
02:05:42,320 --> 02:05:43,920
boy, says

3129
02:05:43,920 --> 02:05:45,679
if i was going to be fighting that army

3130
02:05:45,679 --> 02:05:47,679
i'd be very afraid

3131
02:05:47,679 --> 02:05:49,520
and achilles looks at him right in the

3132
02:05:49,520 --> 02:05:52,880
face as a small child, as a, you know

3133
02:05:52,880 --> 02:05:54,000
young

3134
02:05:54,000 --> 02:05:55,840
boy

3135
02:05:55,840 --> 02:05:58,159
and he says directly to him

3136
02:05:58,159 --> 02:06:00,719
that is why no one will ever remember

3137
02:06:00,719 --> 02:06:02,880
your name

3138
02:06:02,880 --> 02:06:06,320
and it's not in an egoic sense of "i want

3139
02:06:06,320 --> 02:06:07,920
to go down in the annals of history and

3140
02:06:07,920 --> 02:06:10,239
have my name remembered" - it's not that

3141
02:06:10,239 --> 02:06:12,639
that's not the ego place, he's saying

3142
02:06:12,639 --> 02:06:13,920
that from

3143
02:06:13,920 --> 02:06:16,320
he's saying - that's why you won't be a

3144
02:06:16,320 --> 02:06:18,800
truly great person

3145
02:06:18,800 --> 02:06:21,679
you won't be anyone that anybody wants

3146
02:06:21,679 --> 02:06:24,159
to ever talk about and remember, once

3147
02:06:24,159 --> 02:06:26,239
you're dead your name will be forgotten

3148
02:06:26,239 --> 02:06:29,599
forever, it will pass like a snap of a

3149
02:06:29,599 --> 02:06:32,159
fingers from the living systemic memory

3150
02:06:32,159 --> 02:06:35,760
of creation, you won't be anything

3151
02:06:35,760 --> 02:06:39,360
you will be remembered as nothing

3152
02:06:39,360 --> 02:06:40,719
because

3153
02:06:40,719 --> 02:06:43,599
you didn't do great things

3154
02:06:43,599 --> 02:06:46,239
because your fear held you back from

3155
02:06:46,239 --> 02:06:48,000
doing what is right and what is great

3156
02:06:48,000 --> 02:06:51,520
and what is true and what is good

3157
02:06:51,520 --> 02:06:54,320
that's the allegorical

3158
02:06:54,320 --> 02:06:56,400
aspect that achilles in the movie is

3159
02:06:56,400 --> 02:06:58,159
saying that to the child, i should play

3160
02:06:58,159 --> 02:07:01,440
it, i should download it and play it

3161
02:07:03,280 --> 02:07:05,599
maybe i'll do that, i'd like to

3162
02:07:05,599 --> 02:07:07,920
you know, maybe add that jordan peterson

3163
02:07:07,920 --> 02:07:10,079
quote the exact wording of it, i want to

3164
02:07:10,079 --> 02:07:13,040
add that quote from crowley about the

3165
02:07:13,040 --> 02:07:14,560
will of the state, i should have put that

3166
02:07:14,560 --> 02:07:17,199
in the presentation

3167
02:07:17,199 --> 02:07:19,040
maybe i'll do that after the slide, i'll

3168
02:07:19,040 --> 02:07:21,199
just download a couple of things, maybe

3169
02:07:21,199 --> 02:07:24,159
we can read from a couple of thelemic

3170
02:07:24,159 --> 02:07:26,560
writings, as well, but i want to get

3171
02:07:26,560 --> 02:07:28,960
through the philosophy, so

3172
02:07:28,960 --> 02:07:31,440
continuing with this

3173
02:07:31,440 --> 02:07:32,960
"do what thou wilt

3174
02:07:32,960 --> 02:07:34,719
shall be the whole of the law" is the

3175
02:07:34,719 --> 02:07:36,719
apotheosis of freedom and the strictest

3176
02:07:36,719 --> 02:07:40,159
possible bond in crowley's own words "do

3177
02:07:40,159 --> 02:07:43,760
thy will and no other shall say nay", once

3178
02:07:43,760 --> 02:07:45,280
again, that goes back to what we talked

3179
02:07:45,280 --> 02:07:47,520
about in the last part of this slide, in

3180
02:07:47,520 --> 02:07:50,480
the last paragraph

3181
02:07:50,560 --> 02:07:52,719
that if we are doing the true will

3182
02:07:52,719 --> 02:07:54,800
especially in the aggregate

3183
02:07:54,800 --> 02:07:57,360
universal forces come to our aid and

3184
02:07:57,360 --> 02:07:59,679
human life begins to flow effortlessly

3185
02:07:59,679 --> 02:08:01,440
without resistance

3186
02:08:01,440 --> 02:08:03,840
that is what "do thy will and no other

3187
02:08:03,840 --> 02:08:07,880
shall say nay" means

3188
02:08:08,159 --> 02:08:10,800
radio host...

3189
02:08:10,800 --> 02:08:12,960
his name is slipping my mind

3190
02:08:12,960 --> 02:08:15,760
used to say - be bold and mighty forces

3191
02:08:15,760 --> 02:08:18,000
will come to your aid

3192
02:08:18,000 --> 02:08:20,800
very similar to this phrase "do thy will

3193
02:08:20,800 --> 02:08:24,320
and no other shall say nay"

3194
02:08:25,440 --> 02:08:27,760
jack blood, i think, his name was, yes, jack

3195
02:08:27,760 --> 02:08:30,079
blood

3196
02:08:30,480 --> 02:08:32,480
be bold and mighty forces will come to

3197
02:08:32,480 --> 02:08:34,880
your aid

3198
02:08:34,880 --> 02:08:38,560
"do thy will and no other shall say nay"

3199
02:08:38,560 --> 02:08:39,920
that's it

3200
02:08:39,920 --> 02:08:41,199
courage

3201
02:08:41,199 --> 02:08:43,920
it requires courage

3202
02:08:43,920 --> 02:08:48,000
i should put the strength card up

3203
02:08:48,000 --> 02:08:50,320
for that, as well, because that's the

3204
02:08:50,320 --> 02:08:53,280
strength card from the thoth deck is a

3205
02:08:53,280 --> 02:08:55,119
huge aspect of thelema, the

3206
02:08:55,119 --> 02:08:58,239
development of courage

3207
02:08:58,480 --> 02:09:01,360
cowardice stops so many from the true

3208
02:09:01,360 --> 02:09:04,560
will, from the true spiritual path

3209
02:09:04,560 --> 02:09:06,159
they can't get over

3210
02:09:06,159 --> 02:09:08,320
something, there's something in them

3211
02:09:08,320 --> 02:09:11,280
that's incomplete

3212
02:09:11,280 --> 02:09:12,960
there's some part of themselves that

3213
02:09:12,960 --> 02:09:16,320
doesn't love themselves

3214
02:09:16,719 --> 02:09:19,840
you know, i won't let fear stop me, that

3215
02:09:19,840 --> 02:09:21,599
doesn't matter to me, because

3216
02:09:21,599 --> 02:09:23,360
if you know that your consciousness is

3217
02:09:23,360 --> 02:09:25,119
infinite

3218
02:09:25,119 --> 02:09:27,920
what's dying here going to do, transition

3219
02:09:27,920 --> 02:09:29,440
the consciousness from one form to

3220
02:09:29,440 --> 02:09:30,320
another

3221
02:09:30,320 --> 02:09:31,599
so what ?

3222
02:09:31,599 --> 02:09:33,920
it's probably happened to us millions of

3223
02:09:33,920 --> 02:09:36,320
times already

3224
02:09:36,320 --> 02:09:39,360
more likely than not

3225
02:09:40,159 --> 02:09:42,000
continuing with

3226
02:09:42,000 --> 02:09:43,599
"do what thou wilt shall be the whole of

3227
02:09:43,599 --> 02:09:46,079
the law" - is one of the precepts or tenets

3228
02:09:46,079 --> 02:09:47,840
of thelema

3229
02:09:47,840 --> 02:09:50,320
to aligns one life

3230
02:09:50,320 --> 02:09:52,000
with the true will

3231
02:09:52,000 --> 02:09:54,159
is to work toward the state of true

3232
02:09:54,159 --> 02:09:56,159
freedom for all

3233
02:09:56,159 --> 02:10:00,000
to focus largely upon selfish desires

3234
02:10:00,000 --> 02:10:00,800
and

3235
02:10:00,800 --> 02:10:03,040
you know, you could say not even focusing

3236
02:10:03,040 --> 02:10:06,159
on those desires, but letting those base

3237
02:10:06,159 --> 02:10:09,520
desires and or instincts like cowardice

3238
02:10:09,520 --> 02:10:11,119
like trauma

3239
02:10:11,119 --> 02:10:13,920
hold you back from doing that great work

3240
02:10:13,920 --> 02:10:16,800
from being on the path of the true will

3241
02:10:16,800 --> 02:10:19,199
is the same thing as

3242
02:10:19,199 --> 02:10:21,760
letting that

3243
02:10:21,760 --> 02:10:23,520
baboon creature

3244
02:10:23,520 --> 02:10:25,440
still have hold of you, and to take you

3245
02:10:25,440 --> 02:10:29,000
off the path

3246
02:10:29,599 --> 02:10:32,000
to focus largely upon selfish desires

3247
02:10:32,000 --> 02:10:34,239
and or let... cowardice get

3248
02:10:34,239 --> 02:10:35,599
the better of you

3249
02:10:35,599 --> 02:10:38,800
will ensure that obstacles arise for you

3250
02:10:38,800 --> 02:10:42,320
in every aspect of life, every aspect of

3251
02:10:42,320 --> 02:10:44,639
life

3252
02:10:48,079 --> 02:10:49,840
what your purpose is

3253
02:10:49,840 --> 02:10:51,920
where you want to be, who you want to be

3254
02:10:51,920 --> 02:10:53,440
around

3255
02:10:53,440 --> 02:10:55,119
relationships

3256
02:10:55,119 --> 02:10:59,679
resources etcetera, they will all

3257
02:10:59,679 --> 02:11:01,760
have resistance

3258
02:11:01,760 --> 02:11:03,599
there will be something that will fight

3259
02:11:03,599 --> 02:11:06,320
you, every step of the way, unless you're

3260
02:11:06,320 --> 02:11:08,159
really on the path that you're supposed

3261
02:11:08,159 --> 02:11:11,480
to be on

3262
02:11:12,079 --> 02:11:14,719
every act we conduct that is not in

3263
02:11:14,719 --> 02:11:16,480
harmony with the true will

3264
02:11:16,480 --> 02:11:18,079
is erratic

3265
02:11:18,079 --> 02:11:21,199
and will act as a hindrance in our lives

3266
02:11:21,199 --> 02:11:23,679
both at an individual level and at a

3267
02:11:23,679 --> 02:11:25,920
collective level

3268
02:11:25,920 --> 02:11:28,960
once again, the individual wills are

3269
02:11:28,960 --> 02:11:31,360
comprising ultimately the behavior of

3270
02:11:31,360 --> 02:11:33,760
the collective of the aggregate

3271
02:11:33,760 --> 02:11:36,560
and as aggregate morality goes, as the

3272
02:11:36,560 --> 02:11:39,599
quality of aggregate behavior

3273
02:11:39,599 --> 02:11:41,679
either in harmony with objective

3274
02:11:41,679 --> 02:11:43,920
morality or out of alignment with it

3275
02:11:43,920 --> 02:11:46,560
goes, that's how the whole aggregate of

3276
02:11:46,560 --> 02:11:49,119
society goes, and then we get the result

3277
02:11:49,119 --> 02:11:52,320
order or chaos, freedom or slavery, good

3278
02:11:52,320 --> 02:11:54,960
or evil

3279
02:11:55,520 --> 02:11:57,360
it's really not that hard to figure out

3280
02:11:57,360 --> 02:11:59,280
folks, if you know the basics of natural

3281
02:11:59,280 --> 02:12:00,719
law

3282
02:12:00,719 --> 02:12:03,119
and if this is just different wording

3283
02:12:03,119 --> 02:12:05,360
again, kabbalah just different wording

3284
02:12:05,360 --> 02:12:06,639
same ideas

3285
02:12:06,639 --> 02:12:08,639
freemasonry - different wording, different

3286
02:12:08,639 --> 02:12:11,840
symbols, different rituals - same idea

3287
02:12:11,840 --> 02:12:14,239
rosicrucianism - different wording

3288
02:12:14,239 --> 02:12:16,639
different nomenclature, different symbols

3289
02:12:16,639 --> 02:12:18,320
same idea

3290
02:12:18,320 --> 02:12:21,360
there's nothing new under the sun

3291
02:12:21,360 --> 02:12:22,880
you see

3292
02:12:22,880 --> 02:12:25,679
that's what that really means

3293
02:12:25,679 --> 02:12:28,480
you're not learning anything new here

3294
02:12:28,480 --> 02:12:30,480
if you weren't familiar with thelema

3295
02:12:30,480 --> 02:12:32,239
but you were familiar with

3296
02:12:32,239 --> 02:12:34,800
true freemasonry - it's one and the same

3297
02:12:34,800 --> 02:12:36,239
if you weren't familiar with thelema

3298
02:12:36,239 --> 02:12:38,719
but you really have a firm grasp

3299
02:12:38,719 --> 02:12:40,880
of natural law - it's one and the same

3300
02:12:40,880 --> 02:12:43,840
there's nothing new

3301
02:12:47,440 --> 02:12:50,079
in thelema there is a concept of higher

3302
02:12:50,079 --> 02:12:51,040
love

3303
02:12:51,040 --> 02:12:55,280
and this is referred to as "agape"

3304
02:12:55,360 --> 02:12:58,000
the greek word "agape" written there in

3305
02:12:58,000 --> 02:12:59,360
greek letters

3306
02:12:59,360 --> 02:13:03,520
alpha gamma alpha pi eta, and, again

3307
02:13:03,520 --> 02:13:05,520
"agape" pronounced

3308
02:13:05,520 --> 02:13:08,960
"agapE", it's not "agApe"

3309
02:13:08,960 --> 02:13:10,400
or "agapI"

3310
02:13:10,400 --> 02:13:11,199
right

3311
02:13:11,199 --> 02:13:14,320
so, thelema is spelled with that eta

3312
02:13:14,320 --> 02:13:18,239
before the mu alpha, at the end

3313
02:13:18,239 --> 02:13:23,119
theta epsilon lambda eta mu alpha, agape

3314
02:13:23,119 --> 02:13:25,679
is spelled

3315
02:13:25,920 --> 02:13:28,480
alpha gamma alpha pi

3316
02:13:28,480 --> 02:13:31,760
eta, how do you pronounce agape

3317
02:13:31,760 --> 02:13:33,760
you don't say Agapi

3318
02:13:33,760 --> 02:13:36,400
you wouldn't say thelima

3319
02:13:36,400 --> 02:13:39,360
it's thelema

3320
02:13:39,599 --> 02:13:42,320
the eta is a long "ei" sound in classical

3321
02:13:42,320 --> 02:13:43,520
greek

3322
02:13:43,520 --> 02:13:46,320
that's not in question

3323
02:13:46,320 --> 02:13:50,079
so, the correct pronunciation is agape

3324
02:13:50,079 --> 02:13:51,760
just like the correct pronunciation is

3325
02:13:51,760 --> 02:13:54,400
thelema

3326
02:13:54,400 --> 02:13:57,280
and this refers to true love, so, you have

3327
02:13:57,280 --> 02:13:58,960
true will

3328
02:13:58,960 --> 02:14:01,599
not lowercase "w"-will, but

3329
02:14:01,599 --> 02:14:04,480
big "w"-will

3330
02:14:04,480 --> 02:14:05,840
agape

3331
02:14:05,840 --> 02:14:07,280
is

3332
02:14:07,280 --> 02:14:11,360
big uppercase "l"-love

3333
02:14:11,360 --> 02:14:13,760
not the other forms of love, the

3334
02:14:13,760 --> 02:14:16,560
lower case "l"-love

3335
02:14:16,560 --> 02:14:20,159
agape is true love

3336
02:14:20,800 --> 02:14:23,280
which is a different expression of love

3337
02:14:23,280 --> 02:14:26,560
from romantic, familial, or even brotherly

3338
02:14:26,560 --> 02:14:29,280
or platonic love

3339
02:14:29,280 --> 02:14:31,679
in the greek language different forms of

3340
02:14:31,679 --> 02:14:34,560
love were given different words

3341
02:14:34,560 --> 02:14:36,159
the word eros

3342
02:14:36,159 --> 02:14:39,119
transliterated in english e-r-o-s in

3343
02:14:39,119 --> 02:14:41,440
greek it's epsilon

3344
02:14:41,440 --> 02:14:42,560
rho

3345
02:14:42,560 --> 02:14:43,760
omicron

3346
02:14:43,760 --> 02:14:47,679
sigma, final sigma, eros meant...

3347
02:14:47,679 --> 02:14:50,320
means romantic love, that is the

3348
02:14:50,320 --> 02:14:52,840
love between man and woman, between

3349
02:14:52,840 --> 02:14:56,320
partners, life partners etcetera, whether they

3350
02:14:56,320 --> 02:14:57,440
be

3351
02:14:57,440 --> 02:15:00,000
man-woman, man-man, woman-woman

3352
02:15:00,000 --> 02:15:01,679
doesn't matter gender, it's not about

3353
02:15:01,679 --> 02:15:04,639
physical gender, eros is

3354
02:15:04,639 --> 02:15:07,520
life partner romantic love

3355
02:15:07,520 --> 02:15:10,560
physical love

3356
02:15:11,679 --> 02:15:13,840
and then the word philos

3357
02:15:13,840 --> 02:15:17,280
transliterated p-h-i-l-o-s, where we get

3358
02:15:17,280 --> 02:15:19,840
the root from the word philadelphia

3359
02:15:19,840 --> 02:15:22,880
right, love of brother, philos

3360
02:15:22,880 --> 02:15:24,159
delphos

3361
02:15:24,159 --> 02:15:25,360
right, which is

3362
02:15:25,360 --> 02:15:28,159
love brother, brotherly love, the city of

3363
02:15:28,159 --> 02:15:30,719
brotherly love

3364
02:15:30,719 --> 02:15:35,040
the word philos in greek written

3365
02:15:35,119 --> 02:15:36,480
phi

3366
02:15:36,480 --> 02:15:37,679
iota

3367
02:15:37,679 --> 02:15:39,040
lambda

3368
02:15:39,040 --> 02:15:40,800
omicron

3369
02:15:40,800 --> 02:15:43,599
final sigma

3370
02:15:45,280 --> 02:15:47,199
and, actually i should put the final

3371
02:15:47,199 --> 02:15:49,119
sigma, that's not the final sigma, let me

3372
02:15:49,119 --> 02:15:50,560
try to

3373
02:15:50,560 --> 02:15:51,599
write that in there the way it's

3374
02:15:51,599 --> 02:15:53,599
supposed to

3375
02:15:53,599 --> 02:15:57,920
it's still not coming out, no...

3376
02:15:58,560 --> 02:16:00,880
now, i have to put that in there correctly

3377
02:16:00,880 --> 02:16:03,440
because at the end of the word i don't

3378
02:16:03,440 --> 02:16:04,719
believe it should have that, it should

3379
02:16:04,719 --> 02:16:06,239
have the regular

3380
02:16:06,239 --> 02:16:07,920
final sigma-s

3381
02:16:07,920 --> 02:16:09,840
give me a moment, i want to correct that

3382
02:16:09,840 --> 02:16:12,880
while i'm doing this, actually

3383
02:16:12,880 --> 02:16:14,560
this way, i don't forget when i put the

3384
02:16:14,560 --> 02:16:16,560
slides out

3385
02:16:16,560 --> 02:16:18,639
so, just give me one moment to correct

3386
02:16:18,639 --> 02:16:20,880
that

3387
02:16:21,119 --> 02:16:23,520
i'll keep explaining it while i'm doing

3388
02:16:23,520 --> 02:16:24,800
this

3389
02:16:24,800 --> 02:16:25,840
you know

3390
02:16:25,840 --> 02:16:27,840
philos is

3391
02:16:27,840 --> 02:16:29,440
love of

3392
02:16:29,440 --> 02:16:30,480
people

3393
02:16:30,480 --> 02:16:33,359
it's love of family

3394
02:16:35,280 --> 02:16:37,599
it's

3395
02:16:39,120 --> 02:16:40,879
you know, basic

3396
02:16:40,879 --> 02:16:42,799
platonic love

3397
02:16:42,799 --> 02:16:47,799
as separate from romantic love

3398
02:16:51,840 --> 02:16:54,959
i think, i have the

3399
02:16:54,959 --> 02:16:59,079
character, that i want now

3400
02:17:01,120 --> 02:17:02,638
it's not the right

3401
02:17:02,638 --> 02:17:04,799
it's not the right font, just give me one

3402
02:17:04,799 --> 02:17:08,478
more moment, and i'll correct this

3403
02:17:09,439 --> 02:17:12,080
but these other two forms of love

3404
02:17:12,080 --> 02:17:15,120
eros and philos, is not

3405
02:17:15,120 --> 02:17:17,359
what we are referring to

3406
02:17:17,359 --> 02:17:19,280
when we talk about

3407
02:17:19,280 --> 02:17:22,160
a higher expression of love

3408
02:17:22,160 --> 02:17:25,920
that comes from higher consciousness

3409
02:17:25,920 --> 02:17:28,160
these are forms of love that we express

3410
02:17:28,160 --> 02:17:29,920
toward people

3411
02:17:29,920 --> 02:17:31,679
right

3412
02:17:31,679 --> 02:17:34,080
so, in a romantic relationship

3413
02:17:34,080 --> 02:17:37,040
eros would be expressed

3414
02:17:42,000 --> 02:17:43,120
in

3415
02:17:43,120 --> 02:17:44,718
a family

3416
02:17:44,718 --> 02:17:47,519
philos is expressed, or between just

3417
02:17:47,519 --> 02:17:48,879
friends

3418
02:17:50,000 --> 02:17:50,879
you know

3419
02:17:50,879 --> 02:17:52,398
you'd be expressing

3420
02:17:52,398 --> 02:17:54,879
philos

3421
02:17:55,200 --> 02:17:58,160
platonic love

3422
02:18:04,398 --> 02:18:07,040
i still can't find the character, so, i'll

3423
02:18:07,040 --> 02:18:08,638
probably have to just let that go and

3424
02:18:08,638 --> 02:18:10,879
fix it on my own time, i'll have to look

3425
02:18:10,879 --> 02:18:13,200
at a

3426
02:18:13,200 --> 02:18:17,280
program that will allow me to get that

3427
02:18:17,280 --> 02:18:19,519
character set correct, because when i

3428
02:18:19,519 --> 02:18:21,519
typed it in, it transliterated it from

3429
02:18:21,519 --> 02:18:22,558
english

3430
02:18:22,558 --> 02:18:25,120
and it didn't give me the final s

3431
02:18:25,120 --> 02:18:27,679
i need another program to do

3432
02:18:27,679 --> 02:18:29,359
that

3433
02:18:29,359 --> 02:18:31,679
and i don't have it installed here

3434
02:18:31,679 --> 02:18:33,920
so

3435
02:18:34,318 --> 02:18:36,160
yeah, that's not going to be possible for

3436
02:18:36,160 --> 02:18:37,760
me to do on the air, unfortunately, so, i'm

3437
02:18:37,760 --> 02:18:39,679
going to step back into the slides and

3438
02:18:39,679 --> 02:18:40,558
let the

3439
02:18:40,558 --> 02:18:42,080
error be there

3440
02:18:42,080 --> 02:18:43,679
where i should have the final sigma

3441
02:18:43,679 --> 02:18:47,120
instead of the regular sigma

3442
02:18:47,439 --> 02:18:49,439
but i will fix it before i put the

3443
02:18:49,439 --> 02:18:53,080
slides out tomorrow

3444
02:18:54,558 --> 02:18:57,120
so, agape on the other hand means love

3445
02:18:57,120 --> 02:18:58,478
that comes from a higher state of

3446
02:18:58,478 --> 02:19:01,040
consciousness

3447
02:19:01,040 --> 02:19:04,080
it is love of all beings, it is

3448
02:19:04,080 --> 02:19:09,040
the desire for all beings to be free

3449
02:19:09,040 --> 02:19:12,318
in their rights, free, not in bondage, not

3450
02:19:12,318 --> 02:19:14,478
in slavery, and

3451
02:19:14,478 --> 02:19:16,959
for the desire for all beings to be free

3452
02:19:16,959 --> 02:19:18,240
of suffering

3453
02:19:18,240 --> 02:19:22,319
to the extent that that is possible

3454
02:19:22,959 --> 02:19:25,599
agape is universal love, some people call

3455
02:19:25,599 --> 02:19:28,000
it unconditional love, i personally don't

3456
02:19:28,000 --> 02:19:32,080
really like that term, because that means

3457
02:19:32,080 --> 02:19:35,399
there are

3458
02:19:35,439 --> 02:19:38,000
if it's universal - there's

3459
02:19:38,000 --> 02:19:41,280
no real conditions applied to it, but to

3460
02:19:41,280 --> 02:19:43,920
word it as earthly unconditional love

3461
02:19:43,920 --> 02:19:46,318
means, like you'll keep loving somebody

3462
02:19:46,318 --> 02:19:48,478
even if they're evil, and it doesn't mean

3463
02:19:48,478 --> 02:19:51,359
that, that's not what it refers to

3464
02:19:51,359 --> 02:19:54,560
if you look up agape you'll get a lot of

3465
02:19:54,560 --> 02:19:56,800
the christian tradition, because they use

3466
02:19:56,800 --> 02:19:58,720
the word in many christian traditions, as

3467
02:19:58,720 --> 02:19:59,840
well

3468
02:19:59,840 --> 02:20:01,120
to mean

3469
02:20:01,120 --> 02:20:04,960
unconditional christ-like love

3470
02:20:04,960 --> 02:20:07,359
i would say agape is similar to that, but

3471
02:20:07,359 --> 02:20:09,359
i personally would not use the word

3472
02:20:09,359 --> 02:20:10,720
unconditional

3473
02:20:10,720 --> 02:20:14,160
because that makes people think in two

3474
02:20:14,160 --> 02:20:18,560
physical terms of you'll apply this

3475
02:20:18,560 --> 02:20:20,880
mentality, no matter how evil what

3476
02:20:20,880 --> 02:20:22,640
someone is doing is, and that's not

3477
02:20:22,640 --> 02:20:24,560
really what it

3478
02:20:24,560 --> 02:20:27,760
actually, technically means

3479
02:20:27,760 --> 02:20:30,560
i like the term universal love, it is

3480
02:20:30,560 --> 02:20:33,439
love that extends beyond all boundaries

3481
02:20:33,439 --> 02:20:36,479
in that sense it's unconstrained

3482
02:20:36,479 --> 02:20:37,359
it

3483
02:20:37,359 --> 02:20:40,240
isn't... to people it is the love of truth

3484
02:20:40,240 --> 02:20:43,359
and freedom themselves

3485
02:20:43,359 --> 02:20:45,760
it's the love of what is right

3486
02:20:45,760 --> 02:20:49,120
it's the love of justice

3487
02:20:49,359 --> 02:20:52,319
okay, so, it's the love that binds

3488
02:20:52,319 --> 02:20:54,479
together truth and freedom in the

3489
02:20:54,479 --> 02:20:57,200
equation truth-love-freedom

3490
02:20:57,200 --> 02:20:58,800
okay

3491
02:20:58,800 --> 02:21:01,680
that is ultimately what agape is, and

3492
02:21:01,680 --> 02:21:03,280
that's what we're talking about when we

3493
02:21:03,280 --> 02:21:05,520
talk about agape and, of course, i put the

3494
02:21:05,520 --> 02:21:10,359
lovers card there to represent that

3495
02:21:12,160 --> 02:21:14,960
let's move on

3496
02:21:15,439 --> 02:21:17,840
and talk a little bit about

3497
02:21:17,840 --> 02:21:19,760
gematria or

3498
02:21:19,760 --> 02:21:23,120
occult numerology

3499
02:21:23,680 --> 02:21:27,359
it's huge in thelema, and crowley

3500
02:21:27,359 --> 02:21:29,920
really, really, really

3501
02:21:33,840 --> 02:21:36,960
applied gematria to a lot of what he did

3502
02:21:36,960 --> 02:21:38,800
he encoded

3503
02:21:38,800 --> 02:21:40,880
symbolically

3504
02:21:40,880 --> 02:21:42,800
words and concepts

3505
02:21:42,800 --> 02:21:44,640
in number

3506
02:21:44,640 --> 02:21:45,840
in

3507
02:21:45,840 --> 02:21:48,640
many of the writings that he did, in book

3508
02:21:48,640 --> 02:21:49,760
titles

3509
02:21:50,880 --> 02:21:54,160
in concepts and books, in many cases just

3510
02:21:54,160 --> 02:21:57,200
straight out rodent number

3511
02:21:57,200 --> 02:21:59,359
and

3512
02:21:59,359 --> 02:22:01,600
in studying thelema you're going to come

3513
02:22:01,600 --> 02:22:02,640
across

3514
02:22:02,640 --> 02:22:05,200
numerology for certain

3515
02:22:05,200 --> 02:22:08,200
so

3516
02:22:09,040 --> 02:22:12,160
let's look at what gematria actually is

3517
02:22:12,160 --> 02:22:14,240
in just any form of occultism, but

3518
02:22:14,240 --> 02:22:17,439
especially

3519
02:22:17,840 --> 02:22:20,840
thelemic numerology

3520
02:22:20,840 --> 02:22:23,120
so, in

3521
02:22:23,120 --> 02:22:25,600
thelema gematria is a form of occult

3522
02:22:25,600 --> 02:22:27,680
numerology

3523
02:22:27,680 --> 02:22:29,680
in gematria in general

3524
02:22:29,680 --> 02:22:32,319
the letters of words are converted to

3525
02:22:32,319 --> 02:22:34,080
numeric value

3526
02:22:34,080 --> 02:22:36,880
so, let's say, my name mark in english

3527
02:22:36,880 --> 02:22:38,479
gematria

3528
02:22:38,479 --> 02:22:39,840
right

3529
02:22:39,840 --> 02:22:41,200
so

3530
02:22:41,200 --> 02:22:43,439
you could put up an english gematria

3531
02:22:43,439 --> 02:22:45,600
table like "m" has a value, i believe, it's

3532
02:22:45,600 --> 02:22:47,359
13, right

3533
02:22:47,359 --> 02:22:49,520
let me, actually, just look it up real

3534
02:22:49,520 --> 02:22:51,840
quick

3535
02:23:03,040 --> 02:23:05,840
so

3536
02:23:12,880 --> 02:23:14,720
and i have

3537
02:23:14,720 --> 02:23:19,640
a bad spelling here, let me fix that

3538
02:23:20,800 --> 02:23:23,840
gematria has one "m"

3539
02:23:23,840 --> 02:23:28,439
i spelled it wrong a couple times here

3540
02:23:38,960 --> 02:23:40,880
okay

3541
02:23:40,880 --> 02:23:43,200
i think i got it fixed, no, it's spelled

3542
02:23:43,200 --> 02:23:46,600
wrong there

3543
02:23:49,280 --> 02:23:51,600
okay

3544
02:23:53,600 --> 02:23:56,479
doing all kinds of editing

3545
02:23:56,479 --> 02:23:59,479
so

3546
02:24:00,399 --> 02:24:02,560
here's an english... well, i'm looking at

3547
02:24:02,560 --> 02:24:04,960
an english gematria table

3548
02:24:04,960 --> 02:24:06,240
and

3549
02:24:06,240 --> 02:24:07,359
"m"

3550
02:24:07,359 --> 02:24:11,840
is 13, but then you reduce the "m" to 4

3551
02:24:11,840 --> 02:24:13,439
because you add the 1 and the 3 in

3552
02:24:13,439 --> 02:24:15,040
13

3553
02:24:15,040 --> 02:24:17,520
so, the second letter of my name is "a"

3554
02:24:17,520 --> 02:24:19,680
that's 1

3555
02:24:19,680 --> 02:24:22,720
first letter of the english alphabet

3556
02:24:22,720 --> 02:24:24,960
so, if we add the 4

3557
02:24:24,960 --> 02:24:27,439
and the 1 together - we have 5

3558
02:24:27,439 --> 02:24:30,319
then "r"

3559
02:24:30,640 --> 02:24:33,120
"r" is

3560
02:24:33,120 --> 02:24:34,319
18

3561
02:24:34,319 --> 02:24:36,319
in the english alphabet

3562
02:24:36,319 --> 02:24:37,920
18th letter

3563
02:24:37,920 --> 02:24:43,399
the 1 and the 8 add together to form 9

3564
02:24:43,840 --> 02:24:47,760
a 9 as we will see acts as a zero

3565
02:24:47,760 --> 02:24:49,760
but we can add it together with what we

3566
02:24:49,760 --> 02:24:52,319
have so far - 4,1,9

3567
02:24:52,319 --> 02:24:54,399
right

3568
02:24:54,399 --> 02:24:57,040
so that's 14

3569
02:24:57,040 --> 02:24:59,040
and we add that together - we're back to

3570
02:24:59,040 --> 02:25:01,600
5, which is what 1 and 4 are

3571
02:25:01,600 --> 02:25:04,240
so, that's how the 9 is a zero

3572
02:25:04,240 --> 02:25:05,760
we're going to see this in a couple

3573
02:25:05,760 --> 02:25:07,840
moments

3574
02:25:07,840 --> 02:25:11,840
how 9s are always zeros

3575
02:25:12,240 --> 02:25:13,680
but

3576
02:25:13,680 --> 02:25:17,680
let's go to the "k" now, "k" is 2

3577
02:25:18,000 --> 02:25:20,880
because it is

3578
02:25:21,359 --> 02:25:22,319
11

3579
02:25:22,319 --> 02:25:24,720
it's the 11th letter of the english

3580
02:25:24,720 --> 02:25:28,000
alphabet, 1 and 1 is 2

3581
02:25:28,000 --> 02:25:30,080
so, we add that together

3582
02:25:30,080 --> 02:25:31,280
right

3583
02:25:31,280 --> 02:25:34,640
4, 1, 9 and 2

3584
02:25:35,120 --> 02:25:36,720
16

3585
02:25:36,720 --> 02:25:39,200
1 plus 6 is 7

3586
02:25:39,200 --> 02:25:41,760
so, my first name "mark"

3587
02:25:41,760 --> 02:25:43,920
in english gematria

3588
02:25:43,920 --> 02:25:45,600
is a 7

3589
02:25:45,600 --> 02:25:50,080
that's how you do reduction in gematria

3590
02:25:51,040 --> 02:25:53,439
so

3591
02:25:53,439 --> 02:25:56,080
we're going to do gematria on the word

3592
02:25:56,080 --> 02:25:58,160
thelema

3593
02:25:58,160 --> 02:26:02,399
and find its value in greek gematria

3594
02:26:02,399 --> 02:26:05,960
on the next slide

3595
02:26:06,080 --> 02:26:08,560
let's look at some classical occult

3596
02:26:08,560 --> 02:26:10,720
gematria

3597
02:26:10,720 --> 02:26:12,960
the number 666

3598
02:26:12,960 --> 02:26:14,880
depicted at the bottom of this table, on

3599
02:26:14,880 --> 02:26:16,960
the left

3600
02:26:16,960 --> 02:26:21,040
always represented incompletion

3601
02:26:21,040 --> 02:26:22,640
6 and 7

3602
02:26:22,640 --> 02:26:24,319
in numerology

3603
02:26:24,319 --> 02:26:26,640
in the occult world are

3604
02:26:26,640 --> 02:26:29,120
incomplete and complete

3605
02:26:29,120 --> 02:26:32,399
6 is incomplete, 7 is complete

3606
02:26:32,399 --> 02:26:34,720
8 is perfect

3607
02:26:34,720 --> 02:26:38,560
and 9 would represent

3608
02:26:39,200 --> 02:26:40,720
total union

3609
02:26:40,720 --> 02:26:42,800
but, also, in

3610
02:26:42,800 --> 02:26:44,720
a different aspect

3611
02:26:44,720 --> 02:26:47,200
nothing

3612
02:26:47,920 --> 02:26:52,080
union to the point of completion versus

3613
02:26:52,080 --> 02:26:54,240
zero

3614
02:26:54,240 --> 02:26:56,080
and you could look at that as coming

3615
02:26:56,080 --> 02:26:58,800
full circle

3616
02:27:01,200 --> 02:27:04,399
666 always represented

3617
02:27:04,399 --> 02:27:06,240
base consciousness

3618
02:27:06,240 --> 02:27:08,319
incompletion in thought, emotion and

3619
02:27:08,319 --> 02:27:11,920
action, if we ascribe

3620
02:27:11,920 --> 02:27:13,920
one letter of the

3621
02:27:13,920 --> 02:27:16,000
trinity of

3622
02:27:16,000 --> 02:27:18,640
of numbers

3623
02:27:20,800 --> 02:27:23,280
to one to each aspect of consciousness

3624
02:27:23,280 --> 02:27:24,479
thought

3625
02:27:24,479 --> 02:27:26,720
being in a state of

3626
02:27:26,720 --> 02:27:29,040
incompletion or imbalances

3627
02:27:29,040 --> 02:27:30,640
ignorance

3628
02:27:30,640 --> 02:27:32,319
emotion, being in a state of

3629
02:27:32,319 --> 02:27:36,640
incompleteness, non-achievement, would be

3630
02:27:36,640 --> 02:27:38,080
apathy

3631
02:27:38,080 --> 02:27:40,000
and our actions remaining in a state of

3632
02:27:40,000 --> 02:27:41,920
incompleteness is

3633
02:27:41,920 --> 02:27:45,040
cowardice and laziness, that which stops

3634
02:27:45,040 --> 02:27:46,399
you from taking

3635
02:27:46,399 --> 02:27:49,760
right real world action

3636
02:27:49,760 --> 02:27:52,479
that is what 666 has meant in different

3637
02:27:52,479 --> 02:27:54,800
occult numerological traditions, man in

3638
02:27:54,800 --> 02:27:58,920
base consciousness, the beast

3639
02:28:00,960 --> 02:28:03,280
in thelema you'll hear the term "the

3640
02:28:03,280 --> 02:28:06,000
great beast", you know

3641
02:28:06,000 --> 02:28:07,760
or "therion"

3642
02:28:07,760 --> 02:28:09,439
"megatherion"

3643
02:28:09,439 --> 02:28:11,680
"the great beast"

3644
02:28:11,680 --> 02:28:13,520
it's a reference to the beast of

3645
02:28:13,520 --> 02:28:16,000
revelation

3646
02:28:16,000 --> 02:28:18,560
but ultimately that 666 is the number of

3647
02:28:18,560 --> 02:28:20,880
man

3648
02:28:20,960 --> 02:28:23,120
you know

3649
02:28:23,120 --> 02:28:24,240
in

3650
02:28:24,240 --> 02:28:26,080
the book of revelation that's what it is

3651
02:28:26,080 --> 02:28:29,040
said - it is the number of man, not of a

3652
02:28:29,040 --> 02:28:30,880
man, but of man

3653
02:28:30,880 --> 02:28:32,800
meaning that man is in that incomplete

3654
02:28:32,800 --> 02:28:35,200
state, humanity is in that incomplete

3655
02:28:35,200 --> 02:28:38,000
state, meaning mankind

3656
02:28:38,000 --> 02:28:40,399
thought, emotion and action in

3657
02:28:40,399 --> 02:28:43,120
an incomplete inactive and contradictory

3658
02:28:43,120 --> 02:28:45,439
state

3659
02:28:45,520 --> 02:28:49,200
so, then do the gematria reduction, 6

3660
02:28:49,200 --> 02:28:52,399
plus 6, plus 6 is 18

3661
02:28:52,399 --> 02:28:54,560
1 plus 8 is 9, you just

3662
02:28:54,560 --> 02:28:56,000
keep

3663
02:28:56,000 --> 02:28:57,760
adding them together

3664
02:28:57,760 --> 02:28:59,359
that's all you're doing in reduction

3665
02:28:59,359 --> 02:29:01,280
it's very simple, people try to make it

3666
02:29:01,280 --> 02:29:02,560
more

3667
02:29:02,560 --> 02:29:04,640
complex than it really is, gematria

3668
02:29:04,640 --> 02:29:07,200
reduction means adding together

3669
02:29:07,200 --> 02:29:09,120
the individual values of letters in a

3670
02:29:09,120 --> 02:29:11,520
word repeatedly, until a single new

3671
02:29:11,520 --> 02:29:13,680
numerical value is reached, for example

3672
02:29:13,680 --> 02:29:18,240
777, which is the next one we could do

3673
02:29:18,240 --> 02:29:20,399
representing man and unity consciousness

3674
02:29:20,399 --> 02:29:22,479
the thoughts, emotions and actions are

3675
02:29:22,479 --> 02:29:24,479
complete, they're activated, they're

3676
02:29:24,479 --> 02:29:26,960
unified, there's no contradiction

3677
02:29:26,960 --> 02:29:28,800
it's intelligence

3678
02:29:28,800 --> 02:29:32,160
it's true care, true love

3679
02:29:32,160 --> 02:29:33,760
and, then, true will

3680
02:29:33,760 --> 02:29:36,560
which is right action

3681
02:29:36,560 --> 02:29:37,600
courage

3682
02:29:37,600 --> 02:29:39,520
right action

3683
02:29:39,520 --> 02:29:41,280
very simple

3684
02:29:41,280 --> 02:29:43,600
concepts, representing consciousness, but

3685
02:29:43,600 --> 02:29:46,000
then expressed through number, to encode

3686
02:29:46,000 --> 02:29:47,760
them, to encode it

3687
02:29:47,760 --> 02:29:49,600
because at times and places you couldn't

3688
02:29:49,600 --> 02:29:52,000
teach this you could be murdered for

3689
02:29:52,000 --> 02:29:53,760
teaching it, you could be tortured for

3690
02:29:53,760 --> 02:29:56,319
teaching it

3691
02:29:56,319 --> 02:29:58,319
and, so, people have come up with

3692
02:29:58,319 --> 02:30:00,479
ingenious encoding systems including the

3693
02:30:00,479 --> 02:30:02,840
tarot, including occult

3694
02:30:02,840 --> 02:30:06,319
gematria, including allegorical stories

3695
02:30:06,319 --> 02:30:08,880
etcetera

3696
02:30:08,960 --> 02:30:11,280
so, 777 - do the reduction

3697
02:30:11,280 --> 02:30:14,160
7 plus 7, plus 7 is 21

3698
02:30:14,160 --> 02:30:15,680
2 plus 1 is 3, that's the

3699
02:30:15,680 --> 02:30:18,399
reduction of 777

3700
02:30:18,399 --> 02:30:21,439
so, in thelemic gematria it is generally

3701
02:30:21,439 --> 02:30:24,240
accepted that words which reduce to the

3702
02:30:24,240 --> 02:30:27,120
same numerical value actually share the

3703
02:30:27,120 --> 02:30:29,200
same meaning

3704
02:30:29,200 --> 02:30:31,520
and my slides are fraught with error

3705
02:30:31,520 --> 02:30:33,600
today, but that's okay, we'll fix them on

3706
02:30:33,600 --> 02:30:36,000
the fly

3707
02:30:39,280 --> 02:30:41,040
so

3708
02:30:41,040 --> 02:30:46,000
anywhere you would see 777 - you could say

3709
02:30:46,000 --> 02:30:48,399
that's equivalent to 3

3710
02:30:48,399 --> 02:30:51,359
gematria wise

3711
02:30:51,359 --> 02:30:54,080
so, 3 would represent man in unity

3712
02:30:54,080 --> 02:30:56,960
consciousness, again, the trinity

3713
02:30:56,960 --> 02:30:58,880
thought, emotion and action

3714
02:30:58,880 --> 02:31:01,040
body, mind, spirit

3715
02:31:01,040 --> 02:31:03,200
father, son

3716
02:31:03,200 --> 02:31:05,600
spirit

3717
02:31:06,479 --> 02:31:08,640
or father, mother, son

3718
02:31:08,640 --> 02:31:09,920
ultimately the

3719
02:31:09,920 --> 02:31:13,359
mother is the heart, the spirit of that

3720
02:31:13,359 --> 02:31:16,960
equation, and then the divine child

3721
02:31:16,960 --> 02:31:19,120
allegorically is right action, so, it's a

3722
02:31:19,120 --> 02:31:21,600
male aspect

3723
02:31:21,600 --> 02:31:23,200
in the father-mother

3724
02:31:23,200 --> 02:31:24,560
male-child

3725
02:31:24,560 --> 02:31:28,359
son trinity

3726
02:31:29,280 --> 02:31:31,600
and 9 would be

3727
02:31:31,600 --> 02:31:34,800
the reduction of 666, which means it has

3728
02:31:34,800 --> 02:31:36,800
the same

3729
02:31:36,800 --> 02:31:38,720
meaning

3730
02:31:38,720 --> 02:31:40,479
base consciousness

3731
02:31:40,479 --> 02:31:44,080
adds no value, anything you add a nine to

3732
02:31:44,080 --> 02:31:48,160
doesn't change the value, as we just saw

3733
02:31:48,160 --> 02:31:51,600
we had are already five

3734
02:31:51,600 --> 02:31:55,280
"m" and "a" - "m" is 4 in english germatria, "a"

3735
02:31:55,280 --> 02:31:58,479
is 1 - that's 5, add the 9

3736
02:31:58,479 --> 02:32:00,960
14 - 1 plus 4 is 5

3737
02:32:00,960 --> 02:32:03,200
no change, because you already had 4

3738
02:32:03,200 --> 02:32:05,359
and 1 - 5

3739
02:32:05,359 --> 02:32:07,439
any number you add 9 to

3740
02:32:07,439 --> 02:32:09,040
you could just do it

3741
02:32:09,040 --> 02:32:12,240
so, add it to the 3 for an example

3742
02:32:12,240 --> 02:32:13,120
12

3743
02:32:13,120 --> 02:32:17,680
1 plus 2 - 3, you're back to 3

3744
02:32:17,840 --> 02:32:19,439
let's take the 7

3745
02:32:19,439 --> 02:32:20,720
add the 9

3746
02:32:20,720 --> 02:32:23,200
16 - 1 plus 6

3747
02:32:23,200 --> 02:32:26,800
as the reduction back to 7

3748
02:32:26,800 --> 02:32:29,359
adding 9 is adding zero, so, anywhere

3749
02:32:29,359 --> 02:32:31,840
in a gematria reduction, if you see a

3750
02:32:31,840 --> 02:32:34,080
9 - just cross it out, don't add it

3751
02:32:34,080 --> 02:32:35,920
because it's a zero

3752
02:32:35,920 --> 02:32:39,359
gematria wise, it's a zero

3753
02:32:39,359 --> 02:32:41,760
numerology wise, it doesn't add value

3754
02:32:41,760 --> 02:32:44,479
because it represents unconsciousness, it

3755
02:32:44,479 --> 02:32:47,520
represents deadness, it represents being

3756
02:32:47,520 --> 02:32:49,600
totally in

3757
02:32:49,600 --> 02:32:50,479
base

3758
02:32:50,479 --> 02:32:53,120
ego identified consciousness

3759
02:32:53,120 --> 02:32:55,280
which adds no value, you can't change

3760
02:32:55,280 --> 02:32:58,319
anything with it, you can't change value

3761
02:32:58,319 --> 02:33:02,319
for the greater with the 9, you see

3762
02:33:02,319 --> 02:33:04,200
it's something i've been explaining

3763
02:33:04,200 --> 02:33:07,520
numerologically why it's a a brilliant

3764
02:33:07,520 --> 02:33:09,920
understanding, you can't add

3765
02:33:09,920 --> 02:33:12,319
666 to anything and change its value, try

3766
02:33:12,319 --> 02:33:14,960
to do it, start with seven

3767
02:33:14,960 --> 02:33:17,920
add 666

3768
02:33:17,920 --> 02:33:20,479
666 is 18

3769
02:33:20,479 --> 02:33:22,319
right

3770
02:33:22,319 --> 02:33:23,760
okay

3771
02:33:23,760 --> 02:33:26,720
18 plus 7 is 25

3772
02:33:26,720 --> 02:33:29,359
2 plus 5 from the 25 is

3773
02:33:29,359 --> 02:33:31,600
7, you're back to 7, 666 is a

3774
02:33:31,600 --> 02:33:32,800
zero

3775
02:33:32,800 --> 02:33:36,160
in gematria terms

3776
02:33:37,120 --> 02:33:40,640
so, what 666 represents is

3777
02:33:40,640 --> 02:33:42,800
base consciousness that can change

3778
02:33:42,800 --> 02:33:45,840
nothing, it can't add any value, just like

3779
02:33:45,840 --> 02:33:48,640
9 can't add any value, when you

3780
02:33:48,640 --> 02:33:51,520
multiply anything by 9

3781
02:33:51,520 --> 02:33:53,359
you get more of 9

3782
02:33:53,359 --> 02:33:55,680
9

3783
02:33:55,760 --> 02:33:58,960
times 2 is 18

3784
02:33:59,280 --> 02:34:00,880
1 plus 8 is 9, you're back to

3785
02:34:00,880 --> 02:34:03,840
9

3786
02:34:04,319 --> 02:34:06,800
9 times 3 is 27

3787
02:34:06,800 --> 02:34:08,479
2 plus 7 is 9, you're back to

3788
02:34:08,479 --> 02:34:10,720
9

3789
02:34:11,280 --> 02:34:13,920
9 times 6 is 54

3790
02:34:13,920 --> 02:34:15,680
5 plus 4

3791
02:34:15,680 --> 02:34:17,920
is 9

3792
02:34:17,920 --> 02:34:20,080
9 times 7 is 63, 6 plus

3793
02:34:20,080 --> 02:34:22,720
3 is 9 - anything you multiply by

3794
02:34:22,720 --> 02:34:23,760
nine

3795
02:34:23,760 --> 02:34:26,319
you only get more of 9

3796
02:34:26,319 --> 02:34:28,800
multiplying base consciousness gets you

3797
02:34:28,800 --> 02:34:31,840
more base consciousness

3798
02:34:32,319 --> 02:34:34,479
it's just like a brilliant

3799
02:34:34,479 --> 02:34:39,040
conceptual idea put forth in number

3800
02:34:39,040 --> 02:34:43,399
and it's not not that hard to understand

3801
02:34:44,319 --> 02:34:46,560
so, the idea of ascending out of base

3802
02:34:46,560 --> 02:34:49,600
consciousness is to go from the beast

3803
02:34:49,600 --> 02:34:51,760
to

3804
02:34:52,160 --> 02:34:54,000
complete consciousness or unity

3805
02:34:54,000 --> 02:34:57,600
consciousness, to go from 666 to 777

3806
02:34:57,600 --> 02:35:01,200
or to go from the 9 to the 3

3807
02:35:01,200 --> 02:35:04,479
and this is where we get the number 93

3808
02:35:04,479 --> 02:35:05,680
representing

3809
02:35:05,680 --> 02:35:08,399
the journey out of base consciousness

3810
02:35:08,399 --> 02:35:10,240
from the 9 to the 3

3811
02:35:10,240 --> 02:35:11,520
now

3812
02:35:11,520 --> 02:35:15,280
we're going to look at even deeper

3813
02:35:15,520 --> 02:35:17,840
thelemic

3814
02:35:17,840 --> 02:35:19,760
numerological understanding of the

3815
02:35:19,760 --> 02:35:23,760
number 93 in the next slide

3816
02:35:24,960 --> 02:35:26,560
and this is that

3817
02:35:26,560 --> 02:35:28,399
both words

3818
02:35:28,399 --> 02:35:30,479
that are two of the most

3819
02:35:30,479 --> 02:35:32,000
important and

3820
02:35:32,000 --> 02:35:33,600
foundational

3821
02:35:33,600 --> 02:35:36,319
concepts and principles in

3822
02:35:36,319 --> 02:35:39,439
the philosophy of thelema

3823
02:35:39,439 --> 02:35:41,600
actually total

3824
02:35:41,600 --> 02:35:43,680
the exact same number

3825
02:35:43,680 --> 02:35:46,080
when we break them down into

3826
02:35:46,080 --> 02:35:47,920
greek gematria

3827
02:35:47,920 --> 02:35:51,359
and that means, that in the

3828
02:35:51,359 --> 02:35:54,479
occult tradition of thelema, in

3829
02:35:54,479 --> 02:35:56,080
gematria terms

3830
02:35:56,080 --> 02:35:58,640
they actually are the same thing, and

3831
02:35:58,640 --> 02:36:01,280
they mean the same thing, they are one

3832
02:36:01,280 --> 02:36:03,600
and the same

3833
02:36:03,600 --> 02:36:07,040
thelema is agape

3834
02:36:07,040 --> 02:36:08,399
to do the will

3835
02:36:08,399 --> 02:36:09,280
is

3836
02:36:09,280 --> 02:36:10,319
love

3837
02:36:10,319 --> 02:36:11,920
is true love

3838
02:36:11,920 --> 02:36:15,120
the true will is true love

3839
02:36:15,120 --> 02:36:17,120
to do the will

3840
02:36:17,120 --> 02:36:20,800
is to enact higher love

3841
02:36:20,800 --> 02:36:23,840
in creation

3842
02:36:24,240 --> 02:36:25,600
and, of course

3843
02:36:25,600 --> 02:36:27,760
anybody that understands natural law

3844
02:36:27,760 --> 02:36:28,960
knows this

3845
02:36:28,960 --> 02:36:30,800
because to enact natural law and to

3846
02:36:30,800 --> 02:36:33,040
teach natural law that is to be the

3847
02:36:33,040 --> 02:36:35,200
servant of

3848
02:36:35,200 --> 02:36:36,640
the force of

3849
02:36:36,640 --> 02:36:39,280
justice that ultimately rules creation

3850
02:36:39,280 --> 02:36:40,880
you're at the right hand side of that

3851
02:36:40,880 --> 02:36:44,319
that's the hangman card on the tarot

3852
02:36:44,319 --> 02:36:46,399
that sits at the right hand side of the

3853
02:36:46,399 --> 02:36:48,640
justice card, which represents natural

3854
02:36:48,640 --> 02:36:51,760
law or the godhead

3855
02:36:51,760 --> 02:36:54,000
and

3856
02:36:54,000 --> 02:36:56,960
it is one and the same with performing

3857
02:36:56,960 --> 02:36:58,800
an act of true love

3858
02:36:58,800 --> 02:37:01,359
that's to to do that great work is to

3859
02:37:01,359 --> 02:37:03,600
live in heart based higher love

3860
02:37:03,600 --> 02:37:06,240
consciousness

3861
02:37:08,399 --> 02:37:11,040
so, thelema means the true will, not to be

3862
02:37:11,040 --> 02:37:14,000
confused with will with a lower case "w"

3863
02:37:14,000 --> 02:37:17,359
and it totals 93 in greek gematria

3864
02:37:17,359 --> 02:37:20,960
in greek gematria theta is 9

3865
02:37:20,960 --> 02:37:24,640
epsilon is 5, lambda is 30

3866
02:37:24,640 --> 02:37:27,439
eta is 8, mu is 40, and alpha is

3867
02:37:27,439 --> 02:37:28,399
1

3868
02:37:28,399 --> 02:37:30,000
you add up those numbers and you get

3869
02:37:30,000 --> 02:37:32,880
93

3870
02:37:32,880 --> 02:37:35,200
9 plus 5 is 14

3871
02:37:35,200 --> 02:37:38,560
plus 30 is 44

3872
02:37:38,560 --> 02:37:41,760
plus 8 is 52

3873
02:37:42,000 --> 02:37:44,080
plus 40 is 92

3874
02:37:44,080 --> 02:37:47,280
plus 1 is 93

3875
02:37:47,280 --> 02:37:48,960
thelema

3876
02:37:48,960 --> 02:37:50,880
in

3877
02:37:50,880 --> 02:37:55,120
gematria terms equals 93

3878
02:37:55,120 --> 02:37:57,120
and, again, we have that concept of going

3879
02:37:57,120 --> 02:37:58,960
from the 9 to the 3

3880
02:37:58,960 --> 02:38:00,960
the 9 is actually a zero, it's the

3881
02:38:00,960 --> 02:38:03,359
trinity, again - thought, emotion, action

3882
02:38:03,359 --> 02:38:04,560
unified

3883
02:38:04,560 --> 02:38:06,240
on one accord

3884
02:38:06,240 --> 02:38:08,479
united, aligned

3885
02:38:08,479 --> 02:38:12,000
aligned with the will of creation

3886
02:38:12,399 --> 02:38:14,319
on the other side we have the word "agape"

3887
02:38:14,319 --> 02:38:16,240
in greek

3888
02:38:16,240 --> 02:38:18,319
representing true love, not to be

3889
02:38:18,319 --> 02:38:20,319
confused with love with a lowercase "l" -

3890
02:38:20,319 --> 02:38:24,160
the eros or philos forms of love

3891
02:38:24,160 --> 02:38:27,439
it also totals 93 in greek gematria

3892
02:38:27,439 --> 02:38:28,880
alpha is 1

3893
02:38:28,880 --> 02:38:31,280
gamma is 3, alpha is 1

3894
02:38:31,280 --> 02:38:33,600
pay is 80

3895
02:38:33,600 --> 02:38:35,120
you would actually pronounce pi, people

3896
02:38:35,120 --> 02:38:37,280
say pay in the greek

3897
02:38:37,280 --> 02:38:39,760
in the actual ancient greek the letter

3898
02:38:39,760 --> 02:38:42,399
is simply pronounced pi, like the english

3899
02:38:42,399 --> 02:38:44,160
letter p

3900
02:38:44,160 --> 02:38:46,560
it's not pay, there's no long i

3901
02:38:46,560 --> 02:38:50,000
sound in greek unless you combine

3902
02:38:50,000 --> 02:38:52,319
alpha and epsilon, then you have the

3903
02:38:52,319 --> 02:38:53,680
sound i

3904
02:38:53,680 --> 02:38:55,520
from ae

3905
02:38:55,520 --> 02:38:57,439
i

3906
02:38:57,439 --> 02:39:00,560
you know, so

3907
02:39:02,399 --> 02:39:05,280
truly in ancient greek the letter

3908
02:39:05,280 --> 02:39:08,000
that we call pay in english is pi

3909
02:39:08,000 --> 02:39:11,359
is pronounced pi - p-i

3910
02:39:11,359 --> 02:39:16,800
or it would be pay-iota if it was spelled out in greek

3911
02:39:16,800 --> 02:39:18,080
so

3912
02:39:18,080 --> 02:39:20,560
the eta at the end is 8, so, let's add

3913
02:39:20,560 --> 02:39:22,160
them together - 1 plus 3 is 4

3914
02:39:22,160 --> 02:39:25,439
plus 1 is 5, plus 80 is 85, plus 8 is

3915
02:39:25,439 --> 02:39:28,080
93

3916
02:39:28,479 --> 02:39:30,399
so, when we have two equivalent

3917
02:39:30,399 --> 02:39:33,600
numerological values in

3918
02:39:33,600 --> 02:39:36,880
the thelemic gematria system

3919
02:39:36,880 --> 02:39:38,960
it is ascribed that they mean the same

3920
02:39:38,960 --> 02:39:40,479
thing, and they do

3921
02:39:40,479 --> 02:39:42,560
see, that's the beauty of it, right, it's

3922
02:39:42,560 --> 02:39:44,800
not something that's nebulous here

3923
02:39:44,800 --> 02:39:46,479
you're not trying to say

3924
02:39:46,479 --> 02:39:48,000
you know

3925
02:39:48,000 --> 02:39:51,040
truck equals

3926
02:39:51,040 --> 02:39:53,359
angel or something like that, you know

3927
02:39:53,359 --> 02:39:54,960
not things that like don't quite

3928
02:39:54,960 --> 02:39:56,160
make sense

3929
02:39:56,160 --> 02:39:57,520
here

3930
02:39:57,520 --> 02:39:59,920
the attribution works

3931
02:39:59,920 --> 02:40:01,680
and it's perfect

3932
02:40:01,680 --> 02:40:04,800
because the true will is true love

3933
02:40:04,800 --> 02:40:07,120
to align one's will to the will of

3934
02:40:07,120 --> 02:40:10,800
creation is to be in a harmonious act of

3935
02:40:10,800 --> 02:40:12,160
love

3936
02:40:12,160 --> 02:40:14,399
it's...

3937
02:40:14,720 --> 02:40:18,520
it works out perfectly

3938
02:40:20,160 --> 02:40:22,080
and that's why the number 93 is so

3939
02:40:22,080 --> 02:40:23,760
important in the thelemic tradition

3940
02:40:23,760 --> 02:40:25,359
there are other numbers that have a lot

3941
02:40:25,359 --> 02:40:27,120
of numerological

3942
02:40:27,120 --> 02:40:29,279
significance, which we could briefly

3943
02:40:29,279 --> 02:40:31,760
touch on

3944
02:40:33,520 --> 02:40:36,560
so, we saw the number 93 - thelema, will

3945
02:40:36,560 --> 02:40:39,279
totals 93 in greek gematria

3946
02:40:39,279 --> 02:40:42,000
agape, love - totals 93 in greek gematria

3947
02:40:42,000 --> 02:40:44,080
therefore they essentially mean the same

3948
02:40:44,080 --> 02:40:45,120
thing

3949
02:40:45,120 --> 02:40:47,200
true will and true love are equivalents

3950
02:40:47,200 --> 02:40:49,600
of each other

3951
02:40:49,600 --> 02:40:52,240
the number 93 represents ascension out

3952
02:40:52,240 --> 02:40:54,640
of ego and duality consciousness, and

3953
02:40:54,640 --> 02:40:57,840
into love will and unity consciousness

3954
02:40:57,840 --> 02:41:00,160
as we saw to go from the beast to the

3955
02:41:00,160 --> 02:41:03,840
perfected being - the 777

3956
02:41:03,840 --> 02:41:06,399
that's not considered being god

3957
02:41:06,399 --> 02:41:08,319
god's number in greek gematri would be

3958
02:41:08,319 --> 02:41:10,800
888

3959
02:41:10,800 --> 02:41:14,399
so, man still is not the perfection that

3960
02:41:14,399 --> 02:41:18,560
the godhead is the 3 infinities

3961
02:41:18,560 --> 02:41:20,800
perfection and thought, emotion, action

3962
02:41:20,800 --> 02:41:21,920
but it's

3963
02:41:21,920 --> 02:41:24,000
completeness in the physical form in

3964
02:41:24,000 --> 02:41:25,600
thought, emotion and action that you're

3965
02:41:25,600 --> 02:41:28,160
going to reach in the physical domain

3966
02:41:28,160 --> 02:41:30,479
but still not god

3967
02:41:30,479 --> 02:41:35,680
so, you have 666, 777 and 888

3968
02:41:38,880 --> 02:41:41,359
so, again, to go from the 666

3969
02:41:41,359 --> 02:41:44,399
base or beast consciousness to the 777

3970
02:41:44,399 --> 02:41:46,000
man in

3971
02:41:46,000 --> 02:41:48,720
god-like consciousness

3972
02:41:48,720 --> 02:41:49,520
in

3973
02:41:49,520 --> 02:41:52,160
unity consciousness, non-contradictory

3974
02:41:52,160 --> 02:41:55,040
unified consciousness

3975
02:41:55,040 --> 02:41:57,520
is to go from the 9 to the 3

3976
02:41:57,520 --> 02:42:00,160
93

3977
02:42:00,479 --> 02:42:01,520
and, again

3978
02:42:01,520 --> 02:42:03,680
93 reduces to 3, so, it is

3979
02:42:03,680 --> 02:42:06,240
the equivalent of 777, to

3980
02:42:06,240 --> 02:42:09,120
say "93" is to say

3981
02:42:09,120 --> 02:42:11,200
man in

3982
02:42:11,200 --> 02:42:12,560
non-dual

3983
02:42:12,560 --> 02:42:14,720
unity consciousness

3984
02:42:14,720 --> 02:42:16,960
no contradiction in thought, emotion and

3985
02:42:16,960 --> 02:42:19,600
action, completeness in thought, emotion

3986
02:42:19,600 --> 02:42:22,080
and action

3987
02:42:24,800 --> 02:42:26,960
another number that's important in the

3988
02:42:26,960 --> 02:42:28,800
numerology

3989
02:42:28,800 --> 02:42:32,640
is 77 - that's missing

3990
02:42:32,640 --> 02:42:34,880
one of the 7s

3991
02:42:34,880 --> 02:42:37,359
and that's why

3992
02:42:37,359 --> 02:42:38,319
you

3993
02:42:38,319 --> 02:42:40,160
always have to incorporate the

3994
02:42:40,160 --> 02:42:43,520
heart-based intelligence and love

3995
02:42:43,520 --> 02:42:46,000
that's the foundation of everything

3996
02:42:46,000 --> 02:42:47,680
that's the law

3997
02:42:47,680 --> 02:42:50,479
love is the law

3998
02:42:51,840 --> 02:42:55,840
we're going to talk about that phrase

3999
02:42:56,240 --> 02:42:57,600
see

4000
02:42:57,600 --> 02:43:00,880
if you're not coming from that heart

4001
02:43:00,880 --> 02:43:02,880
based intelligence, and it's all

4002
02:43:02,880 --> 02:43:05,600
intellect and ego

4003
02:43:05,600 --> 02:43:10,000
you're operating at the 7-7, the 77

4004
02:43:10,000 --> 02:43:14,880
which is falling short of the three 7s

4005
02:43:14,960 --> 02:43:16,960
so, if you have two 7s out of three

4006
02:43:16,960 --> 02:43:18,160
7s

4007
02:43:18,160 --> 02:43:20,240
you could look at that as two thirds

4008
02:43:20,240 --> 02:43:21,120
right

4009
02:43:21,120 --> 02:43:23,520
and it is true, because the reduction

4010
02:43:23,520 --> 02:43:26,160
7 plus 7 is 14

4011
02:43:26,160 --> 02:43:27,600
right

4012
02:43:27,600 --> 02:43:30,880
then 777 is 21

4013
02:43:30,880 --> 02:43:32,800
that's two thirds when you reduce it, if

4014
02:43:32,800 --> 02:43:34,840
you divide by 7 you get 2 over

4015
02:43:34,840 --> 02:43:37,680
3, and then convert that to

4016
02:43:37,680 --> 02:43:40,640
decimal and you get a repeating 6

4017
02:43:40,640 --> 02:43:43,680
14 out of 21 - two thirds

4018
02:43:43,680 --> 02:43:46,560
which decimally is

4019
02:43:46,560 --> 02:43:48,240
in decimal terms is

4020
02:43:48,240 --> 02:43:51,200
point 666666...

4021
02:43:51,200 --> 02:43:53,520
total incompletion

4022
02:43:53,520 --> 02:43:54,800
forever

4023
02:43:54,800 --> 02:43:57,439
eternal incomplete if the heart is left

4024
02:43:57,439 --> 02:43:58,399
at

4025
02:43:58,399 --> 02:44:00,880
the door

4026
02:44:01,200 --> 02:44:03,680
that is sorcery

4027
02:44:03,680 --> 02:44:06,080
that is intellect combined with egoic

4028
02:44:06,080 --> 02:44:08,560
will, right, that's truly

4029
02:44:08,560 --> 02:44:10,399
"do whatever you want"

4030
02:44:10,399 --> 02:44:12,880
so, if you see the 77

4031
02:44:12,880 --> 02:44:15,760
and it's not being actively unified with

4032
02:44:15,760 --> 02:44:18,640
the other 7, right

4033
02:44:18,640 --> 02:44:20,560
there is a concept in thelema, you could

4034
02:44:20,560 --> 02:44:23,600
see 77 by itself, but there's always

4035
02:44:23,600 --> 02:44:25,439
another 7 to unify it with to bring

4036
02:44:25,439 --> 02:44:28,240
it into balance

4037
02:44:28,640 --> 02:44:30,080
but

4038
02:44:30,080 --> 02:44:33,200
two 7s, 7-7 or 77, left by

4039
02:44:33,200 --> 02:44:36,160
itself unchecked is sorcery, that's to do

4040
02:44:36,160 --> 02:44:39,600
the egocentric will

4041
02:44:39,600 --> 02:44:42,720
that's the dark occult

4042
02:44:44,240 --> 02:44:46,160
intellect combined with egoic will but

4043
02:44:46,160 --> 02:44:48,000
devoid of true care devoid of the heart

4044
02:44:48,000 --> 02:44:50,160
based intelligence

4045
02:44:50,160 --> 02:44:52,000
and then of course

4046
02:44:52,000 --> 02:44:55,279
77 is just one short of

4047
02:44:55,279 --> 02:44:57,279
the number 78, which is the total amount

4048
02:44:57,279 --> 02:45:00,080
of cards in the tarot deck

4049
02:45:00,080 --> 02:45:01,040
so

4050
02:45:01,040 --> 02:45:04,880
you're taking one card short of

4051
02:45:04,880 --> 02:45:07,840
the book of life

4052
02:45:07,840 --> 02:45:09,600
and ultimately

4053
02:45:09,600 --> 02:45:12,080
we know what card would be the short

4054
02:45:12,080 --> 02:45:13,359
end of the stick

4055
02:45:13,359 --> 02:45:15,760
if you remove

4056
02:45:15,760 --> 02:45:18,160
truly the heart-based intelligence and

4057
02:45:18,160 --> 02:45:19,840
true care from

4058
02:45:19,840 --> 02:45:22,800
the 78 of the tarot deck

4059
02:45:22,800 --> 02:45:25,200
ultimately you're taking the fool card

4060
02:45:25,200 --> 02:45:26,080
out

4061
02:45:26,080 --> 02:45:29,120
which represents the soul, because

4062
02:45:29,120 --> 02:45:31,040
to take the heart out of the equation of

4063
02:45:31,040 --> 02:45:34,720
the trinity is to lose the soul

4064
02:45:35,279 --> 02:45:37,600
so, ultimately, all of this has to come

4065
02:45:37,600 --> 02:45:39,760
out of true care, and that doesn't mean

4066
02:45:39,760 --> 02:45:43,600
mushy wishy-washy love, it's not eros

4067
02:45:43,600 --> 02:45:46,560
it's not philos, it's not

4068
02:45:46,560 --> 02:45:48,800
romantic love, it's not even care for

4069
02:45:48,800 --> 02:45:52,000
people, it's care for truth, it's care for

4070
02:45:52,000 --> 02:45:54,479
what is right, it is care for freedom, it

4071
02:45:54,479 --> 02:45:57,840
is care for justice

4072
02:45:59,040 --> 02:46:00,479
that's the type of heart based

4073
02:46:00,479 --> 02:46:01,920
intelligence we're talking about, that

4074
02:46:01,920 --> 02:46:03,600
has to be the foundation of everything

4075
02:46:03,600 --> 02:46:05,120
that doesn't mean

4076
02:46:05,120 --> 02:46:07,200
let's all unconditionally love everybody

4077
02:46:07,200 --> 02:46:08,640
even if they're murdering our children

4078
02:46:08,640 --> 02:46:10,800
that's not what it means

4079
02:46:10,800 --> 02:46:12,640
it means - i care about what is true, i

4080
02:46:12,640 --> 02:46:14,479
care about what is right, i care about

4081
02:46:14,479 --> 02:46:16,960
freedom for all

4082
02:46:16,960 --> 02:46:19,120
agape-love

4083
02:46:19,120 --> 02:46:21,120
once you remove that you've destroyed

4084
02:46:21,120 --> 02:46:22,319
the soul

4085
02:46:22,319 --> 02:46:23,760
and that's where most people are at in

4086
02:46:23,760 --> 02:46:25,439
the world today, they don't care about

4087
02:46:25,439 --> 02:46:26,960
what's right, they don't care about truth

4088
02:46:26,960 --> 02:46:28,479
they don't care about love

4089
02:46:28,479 --> 02:46:29,840
from a higher perspective, they don't

4090
02:46:29,840 --> 02:46:31,600
care about freedom, they have no true

4091
02:46:31,600 --> 02:46:33,040
care

4092
02:46:33,040 --> 02:46:34,560
for anything

4093
02:46:34,560 --> 02:46:35,760
they don't even want to know what's

4094
02:46:35,760 --> 02:46:38,560
going on, they want to live selfish

4095
02:46:38,560 --> 02:46:42,080
purposeless lives

4096
02:46:42,479 --> 02:46:44,720
and that's basically the destruction of

4097
02:46:44,720 --> 02:46:46,640
the soul and being turned into a golem, a

4098
02:46:46,640 --> 02:46:49,040
flesh robot

4099
02:46:51,626 --> 02:46:53,840
so, very powerful that removing the

4100
02:46:53,840 --> 02:46:56,240
one 7 gives us the number that is

4101
02:46:56,240 --> 02:46:58,560
one short of the total number of cards

4102
02:46:58,560 --> 02:46:59,760
in the tarot

4103
02:46:59,760 --> 02:47:01,840
and obviously you're removing the first

4104
02:47:01,840 --> 02:47:04,160
card of the major arcana, the fool, which

4105
02:47:04,160 --> 02:47:07,800
is the soul card

4106
02:47:08,399 --> 02:47:10,640
the number 23, another important number

4107
02:47:10,640 --> 02:47:13,200
in thelemic gematria representing getting

4108
02:47:13,200 --> 02:47:14,479
out

4109
02:47:14,479 --> 02:47:15,600
escape

4110
02:47:15,600 --> 02:47:19,279
but not in escapist terms, it meaning

4111
02:47:19,279 --> 02:47:22,880
escaping mind control, the term "23

4112
02:47:22,880 --> 02:47:25,359
skidoo" was a big thing in the 1920s or

4113
02:47:25,359 --> 02:47:26,640
30s

4114
02:47:26,640 --> 02:47:28,080
trying to think when it even originated

4115
02:47:28,080 --> 02:47:30,640
i think it was the 1920s

4116
02:47:30,640 --> 02:47:32,080
it meant like getting out of the

4117
02:47:32,080 --> 02:47:33,680
situation that you're in, like if you're

4118
02:47:33,680 --> 02:47:34,720
in a

4119
02:47:34,720 --> 02:47:36,080
social function, and you really don't

4120
02:47:36,080 --> 02:47:37,520
want to be there and it's uncomfortable

4121
02:47:37,520 --> 02:47:38,720
and you need to get out of there and go

4122
02:47:38,720 --> 02:47:41,200
do your own thing, you know

4123
02:47:41,200 --> 02:47:43,359
people will call it ghosting now

4124
02:47:43,359 --> 02:47:45,600
you did the "23 skidoo", you got out while

4125
02:47:45,600 --> 02:47:47,359
getting was good and easy and

4126
02:47:47,359 --> 02:47:48,880
zip, you're out

4127
02:47:48,880 --> 02:47:50,399
you know

4128
02:47:50,399 --> 02:47:53,200
this is in thelemic terms

4129
02:47:53,200 --> 02:47:55,279
a reference to that time period

4130
02:47:55,279 --> 02:47:57,200
obviously, you know, i believe crowley

4131
02:47:57,200 --> 02:47:59,600
lived into the...

4132
02:47:59,600 --> 02:48:02,399
i think he lived into the 40s, i have to

4133
02:48:02,399 --> 02:48:04,319
get his exact

4134
02:48:04,319 --> 02:48:07,520
birth and death date, but

4135
02:48:07,760 --> 02:48:11,200
certainly, this was a

4136
02:48:11,920 --> 02:48:15,120
popular phrase, a pop cultural phrase

4137
02:48:15,120 --> 02:48:17,040
during the time that he lived, and he

4138
02:48:17,040 --> 02:48:18,640
incorporated it into some of his

4139
02:48:18,640 --> 02:48:19,600
writings

4140
02:48:19,600 --> 02:48:22,000
in one of them he actually

4141
02:48:22,000 --> 02:48:24,399
calls the paragraph, or the little

4142
02:48:24,399 --> 02:48:25,760
section that he's

4143
02:48:25,760 --> 02:48:27,760
talking about, skidoo

4144
02:48:27,760 --> 02:48:31,600
and it's the number 23, it's the 23rd

4145
02:48:31,600 --> 02:48:34,000
paragraph of the writing

4146
02:48:34,000 --> 02:48:36,560
little play on this turn of a phrase

4147
02:48:36,560 --> 02:48:40,399
back in the 1920s - "23 skidoo"

4148
02:48:40,399 --> 02:48:42,800
getting out while the getting is good

4149
02:48:42,800 --> 02:48:44,640
get out of the mind controlled thought

4150
02:48:44,640 --> 02:48:46,800
prison into which you have been lulled

4151
02:48:46,800 --> 02:48:50,000
get out of the head cage

4152
02:48:52,319 --> 02:48:55,279
and that's the whole idea is

4153
02:48:55,279 --> 02:48:56,160
it was

4154
02:48:56,160 --> 02:48:57,520
don't wait

4155
02:48:57,520 --> 02:48:59,520
get out while you can, while the

4156
02:48:59,520 --> 02:49:01,279
information is available, while you have

4157
02:49:01,279 --> 02:49:03,680
the opportunity, because these sorcerers

4158
02:49:03,680 --> 02:49:04,800
of consciousness are going to be

4159
02:49:04,800 --> 02:49:07,040
refining their techniques and making it

4160
02:49:07,040 --> 02:49:08,720
harder and harder for people to get out

4161
02:49:08,720 --> 02:49:10,840
of the head cage

4162
02:49:10,840 --> 02:49:15,120
of mind-controlled consciousness

4163
02:49:15,120 --> 02:49:16,479
so

4164
02:49:16,479 --> 02:49:18,319
that is what he's saying the "23"

4165
02:49:18,319 --> 02:49:20,720
represented

4166
02:49:20,720 --> 02:49:22,720
take advantage of the opportunity to get

4167
02:49:22,720 --> 02:49:26,479
out while the getting is good

4168
02:49:26,479 --> 02:49:28,640
then we have the

4169
02:49:28,640 --> 02:49:29,560
number

4170
02:49:29,560 --> 02:49:32,399
418 which is

4171
02:49:32,399 --> 02:49:35,600
obviously adds to 13 - 4 plus 1 is 5, plus

4172
02:49:35,600 --> 02:49:38,560
8 is 13, again, a number associated with

4173
02:49:38,560 --> 02:49:41,840
traditionally bad luck

4174
02:49:42,240 --> 02:49:43,600
but in this

4175
02:49:43,600 --> 02:49:44,880
case

4176
02:49:44,880 --> 02:49:47,359
thelema ascribes it to

4177
02:49:47,359 --> 02:49:50,960
a magical term of manifestation, what in

4178
02:49:50,960 --> 02:49:55,520
other forms of magic was abracadabra, in

4179
02:49:55,520 --> 02:49:59,120
thelema it is abrahadabra

4180
02:49:59,120 --> 02:50:01,439
they call it "the word of the aeon"

4181
02:50:01,439 --> 02:50:03,200
it is the word that means the great work

4182
02:50:03,200 --> 02:50:05,680
has been accomplished

4183
02:50:05,680 --> 02:50:07,200
or at least

4184
02:50:07,200 --> 02:50:08,720
what you are trying to bring into

4185
02:50:08,720 --> 02:50:10,880
alignment with

4186
02:50:10,880 --> 02:50:12,560
the will of creation

4187
02:50:12,560 --> 02:50:15,120
that an aspect of that has been done and

4188
02:50:15,120 --> 02:50:17,520
the word

4189
02:50:18,120 --> 02:50:21,120
abrahadabra translates

4190
02:50:21,120 --> 02:50:23,279
as

4191
02:50:23,279 --> 02:50:26,160
"i create as i speak" or "as i speak i

4192
02:50:26,160 --> 02:50:28,479
create" - it's what i talk about all the

4193
02:50:28,479 --> 02:50:30,240
time in my work that

4194
02:50:30,240 --> 02:50:33,040
the universe is spoken into existence

4195
02:50:33,040 --> 02:50:36,160
we create the situation that we are

4196
02:50:36,160 --> 02:50:39,120
experiencing by the power of our voice

4197
02:50:39,120 --> 02:50:42,000
and if we're not using our voice wisely

4198
02:50:42,000 --> 02:50:43,920
we're not creating wisely, if we're not

4199
02:50:43,920 --> 02:50:45,439
putting the information out there to

4200
02:50:45,439 --> 02:50:47,439
others with our voice, because of

4201
02:50:47,439 --> 02:50:49,040
whatever problem we have doing that

4202
02:50:49,040 --> 02:50:51,680
whatever courage or block, whatever lack

4203
02:50:51,680 --> 02:50:55,120
of courage, cowardice, trauma or block we

4204
02:50:55,120 --> 02:50:57,120
have going on in our minds, and in our

4205
02:50:57,120 --> 02:50:57,920
whole

4206
02:50:57,920 --> 02:50:59,600
personality

4207
02:50:59,600 --> 02:51:01,840
that is disallowing us from doing that

4208
02:51:01,840 --> 02:51:02,800
we're

4209
02:51:02,800 --> 02:51:04,800
acting as a

4210
02:51:04,800 --> 02:51:07,600
preventative or a stressor, in that

4211
02:51:07,600 --> 02:51:11,120
regard, to not allow us to do that

4212
02:51:11,120 --> 02:51:13,600
we are not putting our voice forward and

4213
02:51:13,600 --> 02:51:15,279
doing what is right, what we know we

4214
02:51:15,279 --> 02:51:16,560
should be doing

4215
02:51:16,560 --> 02:51:18,960
especially at a time of tyranny and

4216
02:51:18,960 --> 02:51:21,600
slavery

4217
02:51:21,680 --> 02:51:23,920
so

4218
02:51:24,560 --> 02:51:26,319
he called this "the word of the aeon of

4219
02:51:26,319 --> 02:51:28,800
horus"

4220
02:51:28,800 --> 02:51:31,760
because he felt...

4221
02:51:31,760 --> 02:51:34,560
in thalemic

4222
02:51:37,120 --> 02:51:40,960
world view, i guess, you could say

4223
02:51:42,720 --> 02:51:45,200
thelemites and crowley himself looked at

4224
02:51:45,200 --> 02:51:47,920
that we were emerging from a time period

4225
02:51:47,920 --> 02:51:50,160
that

4226
02:51:50,479 --> 02:51:53,120
was a darker time period

4227
02:51:53,120 --> 02:51:56,319
and a constraint on human freedom

4228
02:51:56,319 --> 02:51:59,120
constraint on human potential

4229
02:51:59,120 --> 02:52:01,439
and, certainly, that is true

4230
02:52:01,439 --> 02:52:04,160
he looked at that we would be emerging

4231
02:52:04,160 --> 02:52:05,359
if

4232
02:52:05,359 --> 02:52:08,720
a true occult revival were to take place

4233
02:52:08,720 --> 02:52:10,080
in the world

4234
02:52:10,080 --> 02:52:11,520
driven by

4235
02:52:11,520 --> 02:52:13,840
people in the modern age putting this

4236
02:52:13,840 --> 02:52:16,479
information out

4237
02:52:16,479 --> 02:52:18,800
would give birth to what he referred to

4238
02:52:18,800 --> 02:52:21,520
as the aeon of horus, which was the

4239
02:52:21,520 --> 02:52:24,399
bright conquering solar child

4240
02:52:24,399 --> 02:52:26,240
meaning that light would be coming to

4241
02:52:26,240 --> 02:52:28,800
the world, the light of knowledge, the

4242
02:52:28,800 --> 02:52:30,240
light of

4243
02:52:30,240 --> 02:52:32,319
truth, the light of the creator of the

4244
02:52:32,319 --> 02:52:34,319
universe, emerging

4245
02:52:34,319 --> 02:52:36,800
and it would be

4246
02:52:36,800 --> 02:52:39,680
enlightening souls

4247
02:52:39,680 --> 02:52:41,840
with knowledge that they would carry on

4248
02:52:41,840 --> 02:52:43,200
to others and

4249
02:52:43,200 --> 02:52:45,439
use their flame to ignite

4250
02:52:45,439 --> 02:52:48,319
the flame of the minds of others

4251
02:52:48,319 --> 02:52:50,479
so, it's a great concept the aeon of

4252
02:52:50,479 --> 02:52:51,439
horus

4253
02:52:51,439 --> 02:52:52,240
and

4254
02:52:52,240 --> 02:52:53,359
again

4255
02:52:53,359 --> 02:52:55,120
it represents the great work being

4256
02:52:55,120 --> 02:52:56,800
accomplished and

4257
02:52:56,800 --> 02:52:59,920
manifesting a better result for everyone

4258
02:52:59,920 --> 02:53:03,120
so, 418 is a

4259
02:53:03,120 --> 02:53:06,640
pretty positive

4260
02:53:06,960 --> 02:53:08,720
gematria

4261
02:53:08,720 --> 02:53:13,120
numerology attribution in thelema

4262
02:53:14,479 --> 02:53:16,399
the next concept in thelema i want to

4263
02:53:16,399 --> 02:53:18,720
cover is what crowley meant by magic

4264
02:53:18,720 --> 02:53:20,479
which he spelled with a k

4265
02:53:20,479 --> 02:53:22,880
as opposed to the traditional spelling

4266
02:53:22,880 --> 02:53:26,720
m-a-g-i-c, he spelled it m-a-g-i-c-k to

4267
02:53:26,720 --> 02:53:28,800
distinguish it from

4268
02:53:28,800 --> 02:53:30,800
forms of illusionism

4269
02:53:30,800 --> 02:53:33,120
you know

4270
02:53:33,600 --> 02:53:37,520
basically pop culture magic

4271
02:53:37,520 --> 02:53:39,279
he's not talking about the magicians

4272
02:53:39,279 --> 02:53:41,200
that go and make, you know, the statue of

4273
02:53:41,200 --> 02:53:44,960
liberty appear to disappear

4274
02:53:44,960 --> 02:53:46,399
which is all

4275
02:53:46,399 --> 02:53:50,840
little nonsense tricks and misdirection

4276
02:53:52,399 --> 02:53:54,880
he was talking about actually using the

4277
02:53:54,880 --> 02:53:56,800
power of the voice

4278
02:53:56,800 --> 02:53:59,359
and the power of suggestion to truly

4279
02:53:59,359 --> 02:54:01,279
influence the minds of other people at a

4280
02:54:01,279 --> 02:54:03,760
distance

4281
02:54:03,760 --> 02:54:05,359
so, this is what i've been doing since

4282
02:54:05,359 --> 02:54:07,760
day one, straight out in the open make no

4283
02:54:07,760 --> 02:54:09,760
bones about it, just outright telling

4284
02:54:09,760 --> 02:54:11,040
people

4285
02:54:11,040 --> 02:54:13,600
i consider myself a magician in the

4286
02:54:13,600 --> 02:54:16,399
sense of the thelemite tradition, because

4287
02:54:16,399 --> 02:54:18,880
what it really means is to influence

4288
02:54:18,880 --> 02:54:21,439
others with the power of your voice

4289
02:54:21,439 --> 02:54:25,279
influence others by educating them

4290
02:54:25,279 --> 02:54:28,640
often or almost always at a distance, not

4291
02:54:28,640 --> 02:54:31,359
even having to be in their presence

4292
02:54:31,359 --> 02:54:33,600
communicating the sound and power of the

4293
02:54:33,600 --> 02:54:36,240
voice, the vibration of the voice over

4294
02:54:36,240 --> 02:54:37,920
long distances with

4295
02:54:37,920 --> 02:54:41,439
technological means

4296
02:54:41,439 --> 02:54:43,439
that's magick

4297
02:54:43,439 --> 02:54:46,479
if i could change one person's life

4298
02:54:46,479 --> 02:54:50,080
that's magick, magick has been performed

4299
02:54:50,080 --> 02:54:51,359
think about it

4300
02:54:51,359 --> 02:54:53,600
you've never touched the person, you've

4301
02:54:53,600 --> 02:54:55,680
never actually physically been in their

4302
02:54:55,680 --> 02:54:56,800
presence

4303
02:54:56,800 --> 02:54:58,880
you got ideas to them that they paid

4304
02:54:58,880 --> 02:55:01,279
attention to listen that were expressed

4305
02:55:01,279 --> 02:55:03,279
that were then understood, they were

4306
02:55:03,279 --> 02:55:05,359
translated into their understanding in

4307
02:55:05,359 --> 02:55:07,520
their mind and then they acted upon them

4308
02:55:07,520 --> 02:55:09,600
and changed their lives for the better

4309
02:55:09,600 --> 02:55:13,359
there's no better definition of magick

4310
02:55:13,359 --> 02:55:16,640
in thelemic terms magick is seen as, and

4311
02:55:16,640 --> 02:55:19,520
it's defined as, the science and art of

4312
02:55:19,520 --> 02:55:21,600
influencing change to occur in

4313
02:55:21,600 --> 02:55:24,240
accordance with the will, notice

4314
02:55:24,240 --> 02:55:26,880
capital "w" underlined - the will of

4315
02:55:26,880 --> 02:55:28,319
creation

4316
02:55:28,319 --> 02:55:30,560
so, i'm not performing magick if i'm

4317
02:55:30,560 --> 02:55:32,720
selfishly trying to get what i want, and

4318
02:55:32,720 --> 02:55:35,600
influence people to help me obtain that

4319
02:55:35,600 --> 02:55:38,240
i'm performing magick if i'm explaining

4320
02:55:38,240 --> 02:55:40,560
to people what is the will of creation

4321
02:55:40,560 --> 02:55:42,479
how do you align your personal will to

4322
02:55:42,479 --> 02:55:44,479
that, how do you align your behavior to

4323
02:55:44,479 --> 02:55:46,319
that, do you understand objective

4324
02:55:46,319 --> 02:55:48,640
morality and natural law, are you

4325
02:55:48,640 --> 02:55:50,960
initiating harm, do you know you need to

4326
02:55:50,960 --> 02:55:52,880
stop doing that, are you lying to

4327
02:55:52,880 --> 02:55:53,920
yourself

4328
02:55:53,920 --> 02:55:55,439
about what's really going on in the

4329
02:55:55,439 --> 02:55:57,040
world, do you know you need to stop doing

4330
02:55:57,040 --> 02:55:59,279
that, how do you do those things

4331
02:55:59,279 --> 02:56:01,040
what kind of sacrifice might you

4332
02:56:01,040 --> 02:56:02,640
have to make to do those things - it

4333
02:56:02,640 --> 02:56:05,760
involves sacrifice

4334
02:56:07,760 --> 02:56:08,479
but

4335
02:56:08,479 --> 02:56:12,160
the magick itself is when you're actually

4336
02:56:12,160 --> 02:56:14,640
attempting to

4337
02:56:14,640 --> 02:56:18,240
almost always at a distance

4338
02:56:18,240 --> 02:56:19,760
influence

4339
02:56:19,760 --> 02:56:22,240
change to occur in accordance with the

4340
02:56:22,240 --> 02:56:24,800
higher will

4341
02:56:24,800 --> 02:56:26,960
crowley and many other

4342
02:56:26,960 --> 02:56:28,880
occultists of his time period, like

4343
02:56:28,880 --> 02:56:31,840
helena blavatsky, distinguished magick

4344
02:56:31,840 --> 02:56:34,000
from what they referred to as sorcery

4345
02:56:34,000 --> 02:56:36,720
what i would call the dark occult

4346
02:56:36,720 --> 02:56:40,560
which is the diametric opposite of magick

4347
02:56:40,560 --> 02:56:42,640
it is to attempt to influence change to

4348
02:56:42,640 --> 02:56:44,800
occur in accordance with one's own

4349
02:56:44,800 --> 02:56:47,439
selfish lower case "w"-will

4350
02:56:47,439 --> 02:56:49,920
the will of the sorcerer, the will of the

4351
02:56:49,920 --> 02:56:51,840
practitioner of that influence or

4352
02:56:51,840 --> 02:56:53,840
manipulation, see, that's where it's not

4353
02:56:53,840 --> 02:56:55,279
even influence

4354
02:56:55,279 --> 02:56:57,520
it's manipulation

4355
02:56:57,520 --> 02:57:01,120
you know, i could write it like this

4356
02:57:04,399 --> 02:57:08,200
that's a better definition

4357
02:57:13,040 --> 02:57:15,200
sorcery is the attempt to manipulate

4358
02:57:15,200 --> 02:57:17,600
change to occur in accordance with one

4359
02:57:17,600 --> 02:57:21,080
selfish will

4360
02:57:24,240 --> 02:57:27,840
i don't even have to say attempt

4361
02:57:29,920 --> 02:57:32,920
better

4362
02:57:37,600 --> 02:57:39,760
so, that was the difference in thelema

4363
02:57:39,760 --> 02:57:41,680
between magick and sorcery, and i talked

4364
02:57:41,680 --> 02:57:43,680
about that very early on in what on

4365
02:57:43,680 --> 02:57:45,520
earth is happening work

4366
02:57:45,520 --> 02:57:49,160
in the earlier podcasts

4367
02:57:51,200 --> 02:57:53,279
the next concept in thelema is known as

4368
02:57:53,279 --> 02:57:55,279
the holy guardian angel, and i'm just

4369
02:57:55,279 --> 02:57:56,640
going to briefly touch on it, we'll have

4370
02:57:56,640 --> 02:57:58,080
to continue this next week, because we're

4371
02:57:58,080 --> 02:58:01,120
rapidly running out of time

4372
02:58:01,120 --> 02:58:03,200
crowley seen the holy guardian angel as

4373
02:58:03,200 --> 02:58:05,439
a deep connection, a deeper connection to

4374
02:58:05,439 --> 02:58:08,000
the higher self, which would then help

4375
02:58:08,000 --> 02:58:10,240
guide us toward our true will and our

4376
02:58:10,240 --> 02:58:12,880
ultimate grand purpose in life

4377
02:58:12,880 --> 02:58:15,359
before that to manifest in our lives we

4378
02:58:15,359 --> 02:58:17,600
have to learn to listen to its wisdom

4379
02:58:17,600 --> 02:58:19,279
the path of right action that's telling

4380
02:58:19,279 --> 02:58:21,520
us to undertake by quieting the voice of

4381
02:58:21,520 --> 02:58:23,439
the ego, this is what some of the

4382
02:58:23,439 --> 02:58:26,399
thelemic practices were about

4383
02:58:26,399 --> 02:58:28,800
to help us to hear that voice meditative

4384
02:58:28,800 --> 02:58:30,800
and yogic practices

4385
02:58:30,800 --> 02:58:32,720
crowley called his own guardian angel

4386
02:58:32,720 --> 02:58:34,319
aiwass, whose name

4387
02:58:34,319 --> 02:58:39,120
also totals 93 in greek gematria

4388
02:58:39,359 --> 02:58:41,120
so, i think this is an excellent place to

4389
02:58:41,120 --> 02:58:42,640
leave it, and we can continue talking

4390
02:58:42,640 --> 02:58:43,840
about that at the beginning of next

4391
02:58:43,840 --> 02:58:46,479
week's show where we will do

4392
02:58:46,479 --> 02:58:50,640
the philosophy of thelema part two, and

4393
02:58:50,640 --> 02:58:53,760
we'll expand on this even more next week

4394
02:58:53,760 --> 02:58:55,279
ladies and gentlemen, thank you for

4395
02:58:55,279 --> 02:58:57,600
watching this episode of what on earth

4396
02:58:57,600 --> 02:58:59,359
is happening

4397
02:58:59,359 --> 02:59:01,359
remember, government

4398
02:59:01,359 --> 02:59:03,439
is slavery

4399
02:59:03,439 --> 02:59:04,800
we'll see you right here next week

4400
02:59:04,800 --> 02:59:07,330
everyone, thank you

4401
02:59:07,330 --> 03:00:01,680
